Great work creating RG, VNet and Subnet, creating Storage Account and KeyVault, restricting Access, and creating Web App using VNet, KeyVault and Blob Storage! This VNet integration lab is essential for the Implement Azure Security and Implement Azure infrastructure objectives in the AZ-204 exam. Understanding network integration is crucial for secure Azure applications.

App Service VNet Integration is tested extensively on the exam. Regional VNet Integration connects apps to subnets in the same region, enabling access to VNet resources, on-premises via VPN, and Azure services via service endpoints. Gateway-required VNet Integration handles cross-region scenarios but requires VPN Gateway. The critical distinction is that VNet Integration affects outbound traffic only from your app to VNet resources, while inbound traffic to your app requires private endpoints or service endpoints. This asymmetry appears in many exam questions.

Private endpoints represent the preferred security approach for PaaS services. Private IP addresses in VNet provide access to PaaS services like Storage and SQL Database. Traffic never uses public internet, staying entirely on the Azure backbone. Private DNS zones resolve service names to private IPs automatically. Network security groups control access to the private endpoint. The exam tests when to use private endpoints versus service endpoints, with private endpoints offering more security and granular control.

Container Instances with VNet Integration deploys containers into VNet subnets with private IPs. This enables communication with VNet resources without public exposure. Network security groups provide traffic control. This approach is ideal for batch jobs and backend processing that don't need public internet access but must communicate with other Azure resources privately.

Azure Kubernetes Service networking uses two models the exam compares. Azure CNI assigns VNet IPs to pods enabling direct VNet integration, but consuming more IP addresses from your VNet. Kubenet uses pod CIDR separate from VNet conserving IP addresses, but requiring route tables for VNet communication. The tradeoffs involve IP address consumption versus configuration complexity, and exam scenarios test choosing the right model.

Service endpoints versus private endpoints is a common exam topic. Service endpoints use Microsoft backbone without private IPs, provide subnet-level access control, and work with storage accounts and SQL databases. Private endpoints provide private IPs in your VNet, enable granular resource-level access control, and work with most PaaS services. Private endpoints are the more secure option but have higher cost and complexity.

Hybrid connectivity appears in exam scenarios frequently. VPN Gateway connects VNets to on-premises networks over encrypted tunnels. ExpressRoute provides dedicated private connections bypassing public internet. VNet peering connects Azure VNets within or across regions. VNet Integration enables App Service and Functions to access all connected networks through the VNet they integrate with.

Security best practices the exam expects you to know include never exposing databases with public endpoints in production, using private endpoints for all PaaS services in production environments, implementing network security groups for traffic control, using Azure Firewall for centralized egress filtering, enabling DDoS protection for public-facing applications, and monitoring with Network Watcher and Azure Monitor for traffic analysis and diagnostics.
