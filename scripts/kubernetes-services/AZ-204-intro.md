Great work! This Services lab is crucial for the Implement containerized solutions objective in the AZ-204 exam. Understanding service networking and discovery is essential for Azure Kubernetes Service.

We'll start by exploring the API specs to understand how Services work with label selectors to find target Pods. The exam expects you to understand how Services and Pods are loosely coupled. When running sample Pods, you'll see that labels are the key to linking Services and Pods, and that Pod names have no effect on networking. The exam tests whether you understand how label selectors enable service discovery.

As we deploy an internal Service, you'll examine Service types that the exam tests extensively. ClusterIP provides internal-only access as the default type for inter-service communication within the cluster, getting an IP address which is only accessible within the cluster. The Service has its own IP address which is static for the life of the Service. We'll cover endpoints and endpoint slices where services maintain lists of pod IPs matching selectors, and endpoints update automatically as pods are created or deleted.

When using DNS to find the Service, you'll explore service discovery mechanisms where Kubernetes DNS provides automatic service name resolution and cluster DNS resolves service names to service IPs. You'll see how when you recreate a Pod with a new IP address, service resolution still works because the Service IP address doesn't change. The exam tests whether you understand how DNS enables stable service discovery despite changing Pod IPs. You'll master load balancing and traffic management with services distributing requests across healthy backend pods, and readiness probes determining which pods receive traffic from services.

In the section on deploying an external Service, you'll work with NodePort which exposes services on node ports for development but is rarely used in production, and LoadBalancer which creates cloud load balancers as the standard for external access in AKS. The exam tests Azure Load Balancer integration where LoadBalancer services automatically provision Azure Load Balancers, public IP addresses get assigned from Azure IP pools, and load balancer SKUs determine features and pricing. Know that multiple LoadBalancer services can share a single Azure Load Balancer using annotations.

The lab challenge explores how Services route traffic based on label selectors, testing scenarios with zero or multiple matching Pods. Finally, we'll do cleanup. The exam tests ExternalName which maps services to external DNS names for integration with external services. You'll understand headless services for stateful workloads where ClusterIP None provides direct pod IP discovery and StatefulSets use headless services for predictable network identities. The exam includes troubleshooting scenarios where services not routing traffic often indicates selector mismatches or missing pods, connection timeouts suggest health probe failures, and DNS resolution failures point to CoreDNS issues. Master Service types and Azure integration for the AZ-204!
