Great work! This Ingress lab is crucial for the Implement containerized solutions objective in the AZ-204 exam. Understanding how to manage external access to applications is essential for developing production-ready solutions in Azure Kubernetes Service.

We'll start by exploring the API specs so you understand how Ingress YAML specifications are structured. The exam expects you to read and understand Ingress specs identifying key fields including rules containing host definitions, paths array with Prefix or Exact matching, and backend service references. When we deploy an Ingress controller, you'll see the collection of resources that make it work, and understand that this is the standard approach for managing external access to applications.

As we publish a default app through ingress, you'll understand the catch-all pattern that prevents users from seeing bare error pages. This demonstrates path-based routing that uses URL paths to segment different application parts. The exam tests your understanding of how default backends work.

When we publish an app to a specific host address, you'll master HTTP routing as a fundamental exam topic. Host-based routing directs traffic to different services based on hostname in requests, enabling multiple applications on a single IP address. You'll master external access patterns that the exam tests extensively including ClusterIP for internal-only communication, NodePort for simple development exposure, LoadBalancer creating cloud load balancers per service getting expensive with multiple services, and Ingress providing layer 7 load balancing with single entry point for multiple services as the production solution. Exam tip: questions mentioning cost-effective solutions for multiple web applications point to Ingress.

In the section on using ingress with response caching, you'll understand Ingress annotations for extending functionality without changing application code. Common exam-relevant examples include rewrite rules for modifying request paths, response caching for performance, rate limiting for API protection, and authentication requirements. Know that annotations are controller-specific. The exam tests load balancing concepts with Ingress Controllers automatically load balancing requests across pod replicas.

We'll cover Azure-specific considerations including Application Gateway Ingress Controller as Azure's managed option using Application Gateway instead of running controllers in-cluster with tight Azure integration and Web Application Firewall capabilities. Know that AKS uses standard Kubernetes Ingress while Azure Container Apps uses its own ingress model. We'll explore SSL and TLS termination as high-value exam content where the Ingress Controller handles encryption and decryption with external clients connecting over HTTPS while backend services use unencrypted HTTP inside the cluster, centralizing certificate management. Know that Ingress uses Kubernetes Secrets to store TLS certificates and private keys referenced in the TLS section.

In the lab challenge, you'll practice creating Ingress routing and reconfiguring ports. Finally, we'll do cleanup. We'll cover troubleshooting scenarios including checking if the Ingress Controller runs, verifying backend services exist with healthy endpoints, and confirming DNS configuration matches. The exam expects best practices like using namespaces appropriately, applying least privilege with proper RBAC, and centralizing TLS certificate management. Master Ingress routing and Azure service integration for the AZ-204!
