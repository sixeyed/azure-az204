# Virtual Networks - AZ-204 Exam Connection Script

## Introduction

As you prepare for the AZ-204 exam, it's crucial to understand how Virtual Networks fit into the bigger picture of developing solutions for Microsoft Azure. Let me connect what we've learned in this lab to the exam objectives.

## AZ-204 Exam Domain: Implement Azure Infrastructure as a Service Solutions

Virtual Networks are a core component of the IaaS domain in the AZ-204 exam. While the exam focuses on developing solutions, not infrastructure management, you need to understand how networking impacts your applications.

## Why VNets Matter for Developers

Here's the developer perspective: As you build cloud applications, you're not just writing code - you're architecting solutions that need to be secure, performant, and cost-effective. Virtual Networks enable you to:

### Security Isolation

Your application components can communicate privately without exposure to the public Internet. This is fundamental for any production application. The exam will test your understanding of when and why to use VNets for application security.

### Service Integration

Many Azure services integrate with VNets - Azure SQL Database, Azure Storage, Azure Container Instances, Azure App Service, and more. You need to understand which services support VNet integration and how to configure it.

### Multi-tier Architectures

The subnet pattern we demonstrated - frontend and backend subnets - is a classic multi-tier architecture. The exam expects you to know how to design these architectures and deploy applications into them.

## Key Exam Topics Related to Virtual Networks

Let me highlight the specific areas where VNet knowledge appears in the AZ-204 exam:

### 1. Virtual Machines and Compute Services

You need to know how to deploy VMs into VNets and subnets. This includes understanding:
- How to specify VNet and subnet during VM creation
- The automatic networking resources Azure creates (NICs, NSGs, Public IPs)
- How VMs communicate within VNets using private IP addresses

### 2. Azure Container Instances

Container Instances can be deployed into VNets for private communication. You should understand when to use this pattern versus public container deployments.

### 3. Azure App Service VNet Integration

App Services can integrate with VNets to access private resources. This is a common exam scenario - a web app that needs to connect to a database or other service in a VNet.

### 4. Private Endpoints and Service Endpoints

The exam covers how to secure PaaS services like Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database using:
- Service Endpoints - route traffic to Azure services through the Azure backbone
- Private Endpoints - give PaaS services a private IP in your VNet

### 5. Network Security Groups (NSGs)

NSGs control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet and NIC level. You need to understand how to configure NSG rules to allow or deny traffic.

## CIDR and IP Address Planning

The exam expects you to understand CIDR notation and IP address planning. When you see 10.10.0.0/16, you should know:
- The /16 means 16 bits are fixed, giving you 65,536 addresses
- A /24 subnet gives you 256 addresses
- Subnet ranges must not overlap
- Subnet ranges must fall within the parent VNet range

This is practical knowledge - in development scenarios, you'll need to work with operations teams who ask you to deploy into specific subnets.

## Imperative vs. Declarative Infrastructure

The lab challenge introduced ARM templates - the declarative approach to infrastructure. This is important for the exam because:

### Infrastructure as Code

Modern Azure development uses ARM templates or Bicep for repeatable deployments. The exam tests your understanding of:
- When to use ARM templates versus CLI commands
- How to export and modify ARM templates
- Template parameters and variables

### DevOps Integration

ARM templates integrate with CI/CD pipelines. You need to understand how infrastructure deployment fits into your application deployment workflow.

## Portal, CLI, and SDK

Notice we used both the Portal and the Azure CLI in this lab. The AZ-204 exam expects you to be comfortable with:
- Azure Portal - for exploration and understanding
- Azure CLI - for scripting and automation
- Azure SDKs - for programmatic resource management from your applications

## Common Exam Scenarios

Here are typical exam question patterns involving VNets:

### Scenario 1: Application Security
"You need to ensure a web application can communicate with a database server, but the database should not be accessible from the Internet."
- Answer: Deploy both into a VNet, put the database in a subnet without public IP access

### Scenario 2: Hybrid Connectivity
"Your Azure application needs to access on-premises resources."
- Answer: Use VNet-to-VNet VPN or ExpressRoute (though this is more advanced than basic VNets)

### Scenario 3: Service Isolation
"You have multiple applications that should not communicate with each other."
- Answer: Deploy into separate VNets or use NSGs to control traffic between subnets

### Scenario 4: Cost Optimization
"How can you reduce data transfer costs?"
- Answer: Keep communicating services within the same VNet to avoid egress charges

## Planning for Production

The lab emphasized that you can't typically move resources between VNets. This is critical for the exam - you need to plan your network architecture before deployment. Questions might test whether you understand the limitations and when re-deployment is necessary.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

While not heavily covered in this lab, the exam expects you to know about:
- Network Watcher for troubleshooting connectivity
- NSG flow logs for security analysis
- Connection Monitor for ongoing connectivity testing

## Best Practices for the Exam

As you prepare, remember:

1. Understand the "why" not just the "how" - know why you'd use VNets for application scenarios
2. Know the networking resources Azure creates automatically - disks, NICs, NSGs, public IPs
3. Understand the relationship between VNets, subnets, and services
4. Be comfortable with both Portal and CLI approaches
5. Recognize when VNet integration is required versus optional for different Azure services

## Integration with Other Exam Domains

Virtual Networks don't exist in isolation. They connect to other AZ-204 domains:

- **Azure Storage**: Private endpoints for storage accounts
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: VNet integration for secure database access
- **Azure Key Vault**: Private endpoints for secrets management
- **Azure Functions**: VNet integration for accessing private resources
- **Azure Container Apps**: VNet integration for container workloads

## Final Thoughts

Virtual Networks might seem like an infrastructure topic, but they're essential for developing secure, production-ready applications in Azure. The AZ-204 exam tests your ability to make architectural decisions, and understanding networking is part of that skillset.

As you continue studying, think about every Azure service you learn: "Does this service support VNet integration? When would I use it? How do I configure it?"

This mindset will serve you well on the exam and in real-world Azure development.
