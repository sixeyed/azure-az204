We've covered Azure Files as a fully managed file share service in the cloud using the industry-standard SMB protocol, providing network file shares accessible from Windows, Linux, and macOS - similar to corporate file shares but with cloud benefits. Now let's work with file shares hands-on.

We'll start by creating a file share within a storage account using the storage share create command. Azure Files is a feature of Storage Accounts just like blob storage, both services share the same infrastructure. You'll create a share called labs with default settings for tier and quota that can be modified later. In the portal you'll add directory structure and upload files, which demonstrates a key difference from blob storage: file shares support true hierarchical directories, not just virtual ones simulated with forward slashes. When you try accessing files via HTTP, you'll discover file shares default to no public access and don't have easy options to make files publicly accessible. They're designed to work like network file shares using SMB and CIFS, not web storage.

Next you'll work with mounting the share and rotating keys. You'll mount the share locally on your machine using platform-specific commands. For macOS you use open with the smb protocol and credentials. For Linux you use mount with cifs type, username and password. For Windows you use net use to map a network drive. Once mounted, the share appears as a regular drive or directory. You can edit files locally and see changes immediately reflected in the portal, demonstrating real-time synchronization across clients. Then you'll understand key rotation for security. Authentication uses storage account keys by default, and storage accounts have two keys that both provide full access. They exist to support zero-downtime key rotation. You'll rotate key1 and observe how existing mounts lose authentication. The clever rotation process is to have clients use key1, rotate key2 which doesn't affect connections, update some clients to key2, rotate key1, then update remaining clients.

After that you'll mount the share in a VM using cloud-init automation. The mount script installs cifs-utils, creates a mount point, and mounts the file share during VM provisioning. Once the VM starts, the share is automatically available without manual intervention. You can edit files from the VM and see changes everywhere instantly, showing true shared storage across all connected systems.

For the lab challenge, you'll work on increasing the share quota to allow more data when the share is full, and creating a premium file share using FileStorage account kind which provides guaranteed IOPS and throughput for performance-sensitive workloads. This is different from general-purpose storage accounts and requires choosing premium tier at creation time. When you're done, you'll clean up by deleting the resource group.
