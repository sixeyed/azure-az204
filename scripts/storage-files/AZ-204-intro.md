Excellent work with Azure Files! This is an important storage option for the AZ-204 exam's "Develop for Azure storage" domain.

When you created a file share, you learned storage account fundamentals that must be understood. Azure Files is a feature of Azure Storage Accounts requiring Standard or Premium tier selection. Standard tier uses HDD storage offering locally redundant or geo-redundant options. Premium tier uses SSD storage for low-latency scenarios with different redundancy options and higher costs, requiring FileStorage account kind not general-purpose v2. You cannot convert between Standard and Premium after creation. The exam tests understanding of tier selection at creation time. File share configuration parameters are testable too. Share name must be lowercase and unique within storage account. Quota defines maximum size in gigabytes where Standard default is 5120 GB and Premium requires specifying provisioned size upfront. The exam may test configuring shares with appropriate parameters.

Mounting the share and rotating keys taught you about SMB protocol versions and authentication methods that are critical. Azure Files uses SMB protocol versions 2.1 and 3.0. SMB 3.0 includes encryption in transit which is important for security. The exam tests protocol compatibility understanding. For authentication, storage account keys provide full access and should be protected and rotated regularly. The two-key system you used enables zero-downtime key rotation. Shared Access Signatures provide limited access with specific permissions and time constraints. Azure AD Domain Services enables identity-based authentication for domain-joined machines which is more secure than storage account keys. The exam tests security implications and when to use each method.

When you mounted the share in a VM, that demonstrated integration with Azure services and access patterns that must be understood. Azure Virtual Machines can mount file shares for shared storage. Azure Container Instances can mount Azure Files as persistent volumes. Azure App Service can mount Azure Files for shared content across instances. Azure File Sync can replicate Azure Files to on-premises Windows Servers for hybrid scenarios. Access patterns differ by protocol. SMB access is used when mounting file share as network drive which is most common for VMs and on-premises systems. REST API access allows programmatic access using Azure Storage SDK or direct HTTP calls requiring SAS token for authentication.

In the lab where you worked with premium file shares and quota increases, that relates to comparison with other storage services that's frequently tested. Use Azure Files when you need file system semantics with directories and file shares, or shared access from multiple VMs. Use Blob Storage for unstructured object storage like images, videos, or backups. Use Azure Disks when only one VM needs storage and you need maximum performance. Use Azure NetApp Files for high-performance computing or specialized enterprise storage requirements. The exam tests choosing appropriate service based on requirements and understanding the CLI commands like az storage share create, az storage share update for quota changes, az storage account keys list, and az storage account keys renew for rotation.
