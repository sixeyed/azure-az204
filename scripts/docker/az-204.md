# Docker 101 - AZ-204 Exam Context Narration Script

## Introduction

As you prepare for the AZ-204 Azure Developer Associate certification, understanding Docker containers is absolutely essential. Containers are foundational to several Azure services and appear across multiple domains of the exam.

Let me explain how this Docker lab connects to the AZ-204 exam objectives and your broader Azure development skills.

## AZ-204 Exam Relevance

The AZ-204 exam includes a significant focus on developing containerized solutions. Specifically, you'll need to demonstrate competency in:

### 1. Implementing Azure Container Instances (ACI)

Azure Container Instances allows you to run Docker containers directly in Azure without managing any virtual machines or orchestration platforms. In the ACI labs that follow this one, you'll take the exact Docker images you've built here and deploy them to Azure.

The skills you're learning now - understanding Docker images, container lifecycle, port mappings, and environment variables - directly translate to working with ACI. The main difference is that instead of running `docker run` locally, you'll use the Azure CLI or Portal to run containers in the cloud.

### 2. Working with Azure Container Registry (ACR)

You've seen how Docker images can be pulled from public registries like Docker Hub and Microsoft Container Registry. In production scenarios, you'll store your organization's images in Azure Container Registry, which is Azure's private registry service.

ACR integrates with Azure security features, supports geo-replication for performance, and connects seamlessly with other Azure services. Understanding how Docker images work locally is prerequisite knowledge for working with ACR.

### 3. Deploying to Azure App Service

Azure App Service can run containerized applications, not just traditional web apps. You can deploy custom Docker images to App Service for Web Apps on Linux, giving you the flexibility of containers with the managed service benefits of App Service.

When you're working with App Service containers, the environment variables you learned to set with the `-e` flag in Docker become App Settings in Azure. The port publishing concept translates to App Service's port configuration. The fundamentals are the same.

### 4. Understanding Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

For more complex, multi-container applications, you'll use Azure Kubernetes Service. AKS is a managed Kubernetes platform, and Kubernetes orchestrates Docker containers at scale.

While the AZ-204 exam doesn't require deep Kubernetes expertise, you do need to understand container fundamentals. Everything you've learned about images, containers, and configuration applies to AKS deployments. The Dockerfile you used to build your image? That same Dockerfile will be used to build images for Kubernetes deployments.

## Key Concepts for the Exam

Let me highlight the key Docker concepts that are particularly important for AZ-204:

### Container Images Are Immutable

This is crucial: once you build an image, it doesn't change. You saw this in the lab when you edited code - you had to rebuild the image to get a new version. In Azure, this means when you update your application, you build a new image version and redeploy it. This immutability provides consistency and reliability.

### Configuration Through Environment Variables

The exam frequently tests your understanding of how to configure containerized applications. Environment variables are the primary mechanism. Whether you're working with ACI, App Service containers, or AKS, you'll be setting environment variables to configure your apps.

For the exam, know how to:
- Set environment variables when creating containers
- Understand that sensitive values like connection strings should use environment variables
- Reference Azure Key Vault secrets as environment variables for better security

### Port Mappings and Networking

You learned about publishing ports with the `-p` flag. In Azure services:
- ACI exposes containers on specific ports and can assign DNS names
- App Service handles port mapping automatically but you need to tell it which port your container listens on
- AKS uses Services to expose containers on specific ports

Understanding how containers expose network endpoints is essential for the exam.

### Multi-Stage Builds

The Dockerfile you examined used a multi-stage build - building with the SDK image and running with the runtime image. This is a best practice that the exam expects you to understand. Multi-stage builds:
- Reduce final image size
- Improve security by excluding build tools from production images
- Speed up deployments with smaller images

## Connecting to Other Azure Services

Docker containers in Azure don't run in isolation. They integrate with other Azure services that appear on the AZ-204 exam:

### Azure Storage

Containers are stateless by default - when they stop, any data written inside them is lost. For persistent data, containers can mount Azure Storage (Blob, File Share) as volumes. This is commonly tested in ACI scenarios.

### Azure Key Vault

You should never hard-code secrets in Docker images. Instead, containers running in Azure retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vault at runtime. The exam may ask you to configure ACI or App Service to pull secrets from Key Vault.

### Azure Monitor and Application Insights

Container logs (what you viewed with `docker logs`) get sent to Azure Monitor in production. Application Insights can monitor containerized applications just like any other .NET app. Understanding container logging is important for troubleshooting scenarios on the exam.

### Virtual Networks

Azure container services can be integrated into Virtual Networks for network isolation and security. The exam tests your knowledge of:
- Running ACI containers in VNets
- Connecting App Service containers to VNets
- Network policies in AKS

## Exam Tips and Common Scenarios

Based on actual exam questions, here are common scenarios you should be prepared for:

### Scenario 1: Choosing the Right Container Service

You may be given a requirement and asked to choose between ACI, App Service Containers, or AKS. Remember:
- **ACI**: Simple, single containers, serverless, quick deployments
- **App Service**: Web apps with managed features like auto-scale, deployment slots, custom domains
- **AKS**: Complex, multi-container applications, microservices, full orchestration

### Scenario 2: Dockerfile Questions

You might be shown a Dockerfile and asked to identify issues or improvements. Key things to look for:
- Is it using multi-stage builds?
- Is it using appropriate base images?
- Are build artifacts properly copied between stages?
- Are ports properly exposed?

### Scenario 3: Configuration Management

Questions often test how to properly configure containerized apps. Remember:
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Store secrets in Key Vault, not in images
- Use managed identities for authentication
- Understand how to pass configuration from Azure services to containers

### Scenario 4: Troubleshooting

You may need to troubleshoot a container that won't start or isn't working correctly. Key skills:
- Check container logs
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Confirm port mappings
- Check that the image was built successfully

## Practical Exam Preparation

To prepare for container-related questions on the AZ-204 exam:

1. **Practice building Dockerfiles** for different types of .NET applications - console apps, web APIs, web apps.

2. **Understand the Azure CLI commands** for container services:
   - `az acr` for Container Registry
   - `az container` for Container Instances
   - `az webapp` with container-specific parameters
   - `az aks` for Kubernetes Service

3. **Know the portal workflows** - the exam sometimes shows screenshots and asks you to identify the correct configuration steps.

4. **Understand cost implications** - questions may ask you to optimize costs, and container size, startup time, and resource allocation all factor in.

5. **Practice integration scenarios** - don't just know containers in isolation, understand how they connect to storage, databases, Key Vault, and networking.

## Looking Ahead

This Docker 101 lab establishes the foundation. In upcoming labs, you'll:

- Push images to Azure Container Registry
- Deploy containers to Azure Container Instances
- Run containerized web apps in App Service
- Work with multi-container applications using Docker Compose
- Explore container orchestration with Azure Kubernetes Service

Each of these topics builds on the Docker fundamentals you've learned here.

## Final Thoughts

Containers represent a fundamental shift in how we deploy applications, and Microsoft Azure provides multiple services for running them. For the AZ-204 exam, you need to understand both the container fundamentals and how Azure's container services work.

The hands-on experience you're gaining in these labs is invaluable. The exam includes scenario-based questions that require practical knowledge - not just memorization. By actually building images, running containers, and troubleshooting issues, you're developing the real-world skills that the AZ-204 certification validates.

As you continue through the container labs, keep thinking about how each concept maps to the exam objectives. Ask yourself: How would I do this in Azure? What Azure service would I use? How does this integrate with other Azure features? This mindset will serve you well both on the exam and in your career as an Azure developer.

Good luck with your studies and your certification journey!
