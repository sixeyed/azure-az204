We've covered what Blob Storage is and why it's the right solution for file storage in cloud applications. Now let's get hands-on with the Azure CLI and see these concepts in action.

We'll start by managing blob storage with the CLI where you'll create a storage account and blob container. Storage account names must be globally unique and can only contain lowercase letters and numbers, no hyphens or special characters allowed, which is different from most Azure resources. You'll explore the powerful upload-batch command for uploading multiple files at once while preserving directory structure. Before actually uploading, you'll use the dryrun flag to preview what would happen, which is a great practice to avoid mistakes. Then you'll use the pattern parameter to filter and upload only specific file types like markdown files, seeing how selective uploads work. When you inspect the uploaded blobs, you'll discover that blob names are case-sensitive, so README.md and readme.md are completely different files.

You'll also see an important lesson about public access and security. When you attempt to download a blob using curl and its public URL, you'll get an authentication error because containers aren't publicly accessible by default. This is a security feature where your data is private unless you explicitly choose otherwise. This sets up the need for secure access mechanisms.

Next you'll work with shared access tokens and policies. First you'll generate a SAS token in the portal with read-only permissions and a 1-hour expiry, then successfully download the blob using the SAS URL. You'll learn the security benefits which include limited permissions, limited timeframe, and access to specific blobs only. But there's a limitation: simple SAS tokens cannot be revoked before expiration. That's where stored access policies come in. You'll create a read-only policy using the CLI, generate a policy-based SAS token, and verify it works. Then comes the powerful part: you'll delete the policy and watch as the previously working SAS token immediately fails, even though it hasn't expired. This demonstrates revocable access control which is critical for security scenarios where you need to revoke access immediately.

You'll also explore storage access tiers by changing a blob to Archive tier and discovering that archived blobs aren't immediately accessible. They need rehydration first, which can take hours. This teaches the tradeoff between storage cost and access speed, where Archive tier has the lowest storage cost but the highest access cost and longest retrieval time.

For the lab challenge, you'll work with different authentication and authorization mechanisms to understand the various ways to access blob storage securely. When you're done, you'll clean up by deleting the resource group.
