Great work! This troubleshooting lab addresses the Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure solutions objective in the AZ-204 exam. Diagnostic skills are essential for Azure Kubernetes Service.

Kubernetes validates API specs for correctness when you deploy them, but it doesn't check that your app will actually work. Objects like Services and Pods are loosely coupled, so it's easy to break your application if there are errors in your specs. The exam tests whether you can systematically diagnose and fix these issues.

In this lab, you'll practice troubleshooting a broken deployment, which is exactly what the exam tests. You'll examine pod troubleshooting commands the exam expects you to know including kubectl get pods for status overview, kubectl describe pod for detailed events and conditions, kubectl logs for container output with the previous flag for crashed containers, and kubectl exec for interactive debugging inside running containers.

You'll explore common pod problems that appear in exam scenarios. Pending status indicates scheduling failures from insufficient resources, node selector mismatches, or taint and toleration issues. CrashLoopBackOff suggests application errors requiring log investigation. ImagePullBackOff indicates registry authentication or image naming problems. Error status points to configuration issues or missing dependencies. These are exactly the scenarios the exam presents.

You'll master networking troubleshooting where service DNS resolution failures require checking CoreDNS status and service configurations, connection timeouts suggest network policy blocks or health probe failures, and routing problems need validation. The exam tests configuration troubleshooting including missing ConfigMaps or Secrets causing ContainerCreating status, incorrect volume mounts preventing pod startup, environment variable errors from typos or missing keys, and RBAC denying service account permissions.

As you work through the lab, you'll practice the systematic debugging approaches the exam expects: start with pod status, check events for error messages, examine logs for application errors, verify configuration and secrets, test network connectivity, and check node and cluster health. Finally, we'll do cleanup. We'll cover Azure-specific troubleshooting where AKS node issues appear in Azure Portal diagnostics, Azure Monitor Container Insights provides cluster and pod metrics, Log Analytics queries analyze logs across services, and Azure Support creates diagnostic logs. You'll understand resource exhaustion scenarios including nodes hitting capacity limits, resource quotas blocking deployments, memory pressure causing pod evictions, and disk pressure from full nodes. Master troubleshooting methodology and kubectl diagnostic commands for the AZ-204!
