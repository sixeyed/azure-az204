Great job setting up Application Gateway ingress! Now let's focus on what the AZ-204 exam expects you to know about AKS networking and ingress patterns.

This topic covers multiple exam domains including containerized solutions for AKS deployment and configuration, networking for Application Gateway integration, and security through VNet segmentation and RBAC. Expect scenario questions about choosing the right load balancing solution and troubleshooting ingress issues.

Layer 4 versus Layer 7 load balancing is fundamental exam knowledge. Azure Load Balancer operates at Layer 4, the transport layer, and makes routing decisions based on IP address and port. It's fast but not content-aware, so it can't look at HTTP headers or URL paths. Application Gateway operates at Layer 7, the application layer, and can route based on HTTP headers, paths, and domain names. It's more intelligent and feature-rich but adds a bit of latency. The exam tests when to use each based on scenario requirements.

Service types in Kubernetes appear frequently on the exam. ClusterIP makes services accessible only within the cluster for internal communication between pods. NodePort exposes services on a specific port on every node, but it's rarely used in production AKS. LoadBalancer provisions an Azure Load Balancer with a public IP, but each service gets its own IP address, which can get expensive and difficult to manage. Ingress uses Layer 7 routing to share a single public IP across multiple services, which is the recommended approach for production. Know when to use each type based on the scenario presented.

Azure CNI versus kubenet networking plugins is a common exam topic that tests your understanding of trade-offs. Azure CNI gives each pod its own VNet IP address, which enables service endpoints and network policies, but it consumes more IP addresses from your VNet address space. Kubenet uses an overlay network where pods get IPs from a separate CIDR range, which is more IP-efficient but doesn't support service endpoints or some advanced networking features. Scenario questions will test which to choose based on requirements like IP address availability, service endpoint needs, and security requirements.

Application Gateway requirements need to be thoroughly understood for design questions. AGIC requires either Standard_v2 or WAF_v2 SKU because v1 isn't supported with the ingress controller. Application Gateway needs its own dedicated subnet that can't contain other resources, and the subnet must be large enough to accommodate scale-out instances. These are common constraints that appear in exam questions.

AGIC architecture may appear in troubleshooting scenarios. Understand that AGIC runs as a pod in your AKS cluster, watches for Kubernetes Ingress resources, and translates them into Application Gateway configuration via the Azure ARM API. If ingress isn't working, you need to know to check the AGIC pod logs for errors, verify managed identity permissions for the cluster to modify Application Gateway, and ensure Application Gateway is in the same VNet as the AKS cluster.

Ingress annotations for controlling Application Gateway behavior are tested in questions about customizing routing. You can use annotations to configure SSL redirection, cookie-based session affinity, connection draining, and backend protocol settings. Know the common annotations and what they control.

SSL termination patterns appear in security-focused questions. Understand that Application Gateway can terminate SSL at the gateway level, reducing CPU load on your pods, or you can use end-to-end SSL encryption all the way to the pods. Know when to use each pattern.

WAF integration for security is an important topic. Web Application Firewall is a feature of Application Gateway that protects against common web exploits like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Know that WAF requires the WAF_v2 SKU and understand how it integrates with AGIC.

Throughout our review, we'll work through common exam scenarios about choosing between LoadBalancer services and Ingress, troubleshooting ingress configuration issues, and implementing SSL termination. Master ingress patterns for the AZ-204!
