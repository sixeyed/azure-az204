Excellent work with the hands-on exercises. Now let's focus on what the AZ-204 exam expects you to know about multi-container deployments on ACI.

The exam tests your understanding of container groups extensively. You need to know how multiple containers scheduled on the same host share lifecycle, network, and storage resources. The key concept is that containers in a group can communicate using localhost because they share the same network namespace. This is fundamentally different from deploying separate container instances, where containers would need to communicate over external networking. Expect scenario questions about when to use a container group versus multiple separate container instances.

The ACI YAML specification is Azure's proprietary format for defining container groups, and the exam loves to test whether you know which fields are required versus optional. CPU and memory specifications are mandatory in ACI YAML, unlike Docker Compose where they default to reasonable values. You need to understand the proper structure for defining ports at both the container level and the IP address level, which is a common exam gotcha. Many candidates forget that you need to expose ports in both places for external access to work.

Docker Compose integration is another testable topic. You need to know the exact command sequence: first docker login azure, then docker context create aci with a resource group specification, then docker context use to switch to that context, and finally standard docker compose commands work just like they do locally. The exam may ask troubleshooting questions like why can't I see my Azure containers, which often relates to which Docker context is currently active. You also need to know that the Docker ACI integration automatically creates sidecar containers for networking, so seeing more containers than you defined is expected behavior.

Container updates and lifecycle is a critical exam concept. You cannot update the configuration of running containers. Any change to environment variables, resource limits, port mappings, or volumes requires recreating the container completely. ACI kills the old containers and starts new ones, which causes temporary downtime. Expect scenario questions about what happens when you redeploy with changed configuration, and know that updates are not done in-place.

Storage integration appears frequently on the exam. You need to understand the difference between Azure Blob Storage, which is accessed via connection strings and SDKs from application code, and Azure Files, which is mounted as volumes in the filesystem. The exam tests whether you know that Blob Storage requires application code changes to work with the storage APIs, while Azure Files mounting is transparent to the application. The app just reads and writes files normally, unaware that they're stored remotely.

Connection strings, storage account keys, and secure credential management round out the security topics. The exam wants you to know that hardcoding credentials in YAML files is not secure for production use. Azure Key Vault or managed identities are the recommended approaches, and you should recommend those in scenario questions about securing connection strings and storage keys.

Networking in container groups is tested through understanding how containers share a single public IP address, how to map ports for external access, and how inter-container communication works using localhost. You need to know that only one container in the group can listen on any particular port, since they share the network namespace.

Docker context management for switching between local Docker and ACI is important for practical questions about using the Docker CLI. You need to know how to list contexts, switch between them, and understand which context your commands are targeting.

We'll work through common exam scenarios covering multi-container communication, persistent data storage, configuration updates, and secure credential management, along with the CLI commands you need to memorize for test day. Ready to master multi-container ACI deployments for the exam? Let's go!
