Great work with Log Analytics! This is essential knowledge for the AZ-204's monitoring and troubleshooting objectives.

The exercises took you through generating log data first, which is where you learned about the modern architecture of workspace-based Application Insights. The exam really focuses on understanding this integration where all your Application Insights telemetry flows into Log Analytics, giving you cross-resource queries, longer retention options, and consistent querying across all your monitoring data. This is different from classic Application Insights, and you need to know why the workspace-based approach is the preferred modern pattern.

When you were querying application logs, you got hands-on with KQL and those pipe operators that chain operations together. The exam will test your ability to read and write these queries, so make sure you understand how the pipe sends output from one operator as input to the next. You also need to memorize which tables store what kind of data. AppTraces is for logging statements, AppEvents for custom tracked events, AppMetrics for custom metrics, AppDependencies for external service calls, AppRequests for incoming HTTP requests, and AppExceptions for errors with stack traces. The exam often asks which table to query for specific troubleshooting scenarios.

The section on aggregating application metrics showed you how to summarize data and create time-based groupings. This is crucial for the exam because troubleshooting questions often require you to find slow dependencies, calculate success rates, or analyze custom metrics over time. You need to know operators like where for filtering, summarize for aggregations, bin for time bucketing, and how to optimize queries by filtering early in the pipeline.

The lab where you created a workbook ties into exam topics about building monitoring dashboards and configuring visualization. Workbooks combine multiple KQL queries into operational views, and understanding how to build them shows you grasp the full monitoring picture, not just individual queries.

Throughout all this, remember that workspaces can receive data from multiple sources, not just Application Insights. You can have VMs with monitoring agents, Azure resources with diagnostic settings, and multiple Application Insights instances all feeding into one workspace for centralized monitoring. The exam tests understanding of this architecture and the benefits like Azure role-based access control integration, cost optimization with commitment tiers, and support for features like alerts and dashboards. When you cleaned up at the end, that was about understanding the resource lifecycle and how Log Analytics data is tied to the workspace resource.
