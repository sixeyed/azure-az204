Excellent work optimizing images! Multi-stage builds are the industry standard and directly support AZ-204 objectives for container management. Let's think about what the exam expects you to know from these exercises.

Image size optimization is critical for Azure Container Registry integration. Smaller images mean faster push times with less data to upload, faster pull times giving quicker deployments to ACI or App Service, lower storage costs because ACR charges for storage, and quicker cold starts. The exam tests understanding of why image size matters and how to minimize it through proper Dockerfile design and multi-stage builds.

Multi-stage builds as the industry standard for production containers need to be understood. Build stage with SDK and tools, test stage for running unit tests, final stage with only runtime dependencies. The pattern eliminates unnecessary files from production images. The exam may present Dockerfile examples and ask about optimization strategies or identify which stage would be used for different purposes.

BuildKit features improve build performance with parallel execution where multiple stages build simultaneously, intelligent caching that skips unchanged stages, and advanced features like secrets handling. While BuildKit specifics may not be heavily tested, understanding build optimization matters for CI/CD scenarios where build time directly impacts deployment speed.

Targeting specific stages enables using one Dockerfile for multiple purposes. Use target test for CI/CD testing, target development for local debugging with extra tools, and no target flag for production build. The exam tests understanding of how single Dockerfiles can serve multiple needs without maintaining separate Dockerfile variants.

Security benefits of smaller images include reduced attack surface where fewer packages means fewer vulnerabilities, no build tools in production where compilers and debuggers aren't exploitable if they're not there, and separation of build-time secrets. The exam tests security best practices for containerized applications and understanding the security implications of image composition.

Azure Container Registry integration with multi-stage builds means faster CI/CD pipelines with quick image updates, efficient storage usage, and optimized deployments. The exam tests understanding of how ACR integrates with build processes and how image size affects deployment speed to ACI, App Service, and AKS. You should also understand Dockerfile best practices, layer caching strategies, common optimization patterns, security hardening, and exam scenarios about troubleshooting builds, choosing base images, and designing CI/CD pipelines. Master multi-stage builds for the AZ-204!
