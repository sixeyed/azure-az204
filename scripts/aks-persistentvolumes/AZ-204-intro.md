Great job working with Kubernetes storage! Now let's focus on what the AZ-204 exam expects you to know about persistent storage in containerized applications.

This addresses the containerized solutions domain of AZ-204, specifically covering AKS storage concepts and abstractions. Expect questions about choosing appropriate storage types, understanding data lifecycle across different failure scenarios, and troubleshooting storage mounting issues.

Storage lifecycle is fundamental exam knowledge that's heavily tested across different question types. Container filesystems are ephemeral, meaning data is lost when containers are deleted even if the Pod remains running. EmptyDir volumes survive container restarts but not Pod deletion, so they're Pod-scoped. PersistentVolumes survive Pod deletion and can be reattached to new Pods, making them cluster-scoped resources. The exam tests your understanding of what happens to data during various failure and replacement scenarios, like when a container crashes, when a Pod is deleted and recreated, or when a node fails.

PersistentVolumeClaims with Storage Classes appear on almost every AKS exam question involving storage. A PVC is a request for storage with specific requirements including size, access mode, and optionally a storage class. Storage Classes define the provisioner, which is what actually creates the storage, along with parameters specific to that storage type. In AKS, the default storage class uses Azure Managed Disks with dynamic provisioning, meaning storage is automatically created when you create a PVC without having to pre-provision volumes. Know how to create PVCs with the right specifications and how to reference them in Pod specs using volume and volumeMount declarations.

Azure Managed Disks versus Azure Files is a critical exam topic that appears in scenario questions. Managed Disks support only ReadWriteOnce access mode, meaning only one Pod can mount the volume at a time. They're high-performance, SSD-backed, and ideal for databases and applications that need exclusive access to storage. Azure Files supports ReadWriteMany, allowing multiple Pods to mount concurrently. It uses SMB or NFS protocols, is slightly slower than Managed Disks, and is ideal for shared data scenarios like content management systems or shared caches. Scenario questions test which to choose based on whether you need shared access across multiple Pods.

Access modes need to be memorized because they're tested directly. ReadWriteOnce (RWO) means the volume can be mounted read-write by a single node. ReadOnlyMany (ROX) means it can be mounted read-only by many nodes. ReadWriteMany (RWX) means it can be mounted read-write by many nodes. Know that Azure Managed Disks support only RWO, while Azure Files supports all three modes. The exam tests which mode to request in your PVC based on application requirements like number of replicas and whether they need concurrent write access.

ConfigMaps for application configuration is a related exam topic. ConfigMaps store non-sensitive configuration as key-value pairs or files, and can be mounted as volumes or exposed as environment variables. Know when to use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive config like feature flags and API endpoints, Secrets for sensitive data like passwords and connection strings, and PersistentVolumes for application data that needs to persist like databases and user uploads.

Dynamic provisioning is tested in questions about how storage is created. When you create a PVC without specifying a specific PersistentVolume, Kubernetes uses the storage class to dynamically provision new storage. In AKS, this means Azure automatically creates a Managed Disk or File Share. Understand the difference between dynamic provisioning and static provisioning where you pre-create volumes.

Storage class parameters appear in advanced questions. Different storage classes can specify different SKUs like Premium_LRS for SSDs or Standard_LRS for HDDs, replication types, and performance tiers. Know the common parameters for Azure storage classes.

Volume snapshots and backups are tested in disaster recovery scenarios. AKS supports volume snapshots for creating point-in-time copies of persistent volumes, which can be used for backups or cloning data.

Troubleshooting mount issues appears in scenario questions. Common problems include PVC stuck in Pending state because no storage class matches, Pod stuck in ContainerCreating because the volume can't attach, and mount failures due to access mode conflicts when multiple Pods try to mount RWO volumes.

Throughout our review, we'll work through common exam scenarios about choosing storage solutions for different application patterns like StatefulSets for databases, shared caches across multiple replicas, and content management systems needing concurrent access. Master persistent storage for the AZ-204 exam!
