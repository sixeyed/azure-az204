# App Service CI/CD - AZ-204 Exam Exercises

App Service continuous deployment and deployment slots are fundamental topics for the AZ-204 certification exam, appearing frequently in the Implement Azure App Service web apps domain which accounts for fifteen to twenty percent of your exam score. These exercises focus specifically on CI/CD workflows, automated deployment, and zero-downtime deployment strategies that you'll encounter in both the exam and production scenarios. The AZ-204 exam tests not just your ability to configure deployments, but your understanding of when to use different deployment strategies and how to implement production-grade release pipelines.

## Prerequisites

You should complete the basic App Service labs before diving into these CI/CD-focused exercises. Understanding App Service Plans, web app creation, and basic configuration management is essential groundwork. These advanced exercises assume you're comfortable with those fundamentals and ready to explore automated deployment workflows and staging strategies that are critical for modern cloud development.

## AZ-204 Exam Skills Covered

The exam expects you to demonstrate competency in continuous deployment scenarios. You need to understand deployment source configuration including how to connect App Service to GitHub, Azure Repos, Bitbucket, and local Git repositories. Configuring automated builds and deployments is crucial because the exam tests scenarios where code changes must automatically flow through your pipeline. Understanding deployment slots and their role in zero-downtime deployments appears throughout the exam because this is how production applications handle updates safely. Swapping slots and understanding what configuration moves versus what stays is a common exam question. Finally, you must understand the relationship between source control branches and deployment targets because branch-based deployment strategies are the foundation of modern CI/CD workflows.

## Deployment Source Control

Understanding the different deployment approaches is critical for the AZ-204 exam. Manual integration provides a deployment source that must be explicitly synchronized. Azure can read from the repository but won't automatically deploy when code changes. This approach works for scenarios where you want complete control over when deployments happen, perhaps because you need manual approval or want to coordinate deployments with other activities. The exam might present scenarios where manual control is required, and you need to recognize that manual integration is the appropriate choice.

Continuous integration removes the manual step by configuring webhooks that trigger deployments automatically. When you push code to GitHub, the webhook notifies Azure, which pulls the latest code, builds it, and deploys it without any manual intervention. This automation is standard practice for modern applications and appears frequently in exam scenarios. Understanding how to configure the authentication using GitHub Personal Access Tokens and what permissions are required is important because the exam tests implementation details, not just concepts.

The key difference between manual and continuous integration is the triggering mechanism. Manual requires you to click Sync in the Portal or run a CLI command. Continuous happens automatically whenever code is pushed to the configured branch. Both use the same underlying build and deployment infrastructure, but the automation level differs significantly. The exam frequently tests your understanding of which approach is appropriate for different scenarios.

## GitHub Integration

Understanding GitHub-specific integration is important for the AZ-204 exam because GitHub is increasingly common in enterprise environments. Authentication requires a Personal Access Token with specific permissions. The workflow permission allows Azure to create and manage GitHub Actions workflows in your repository. The admin:repo_hook permission allows Azure to create webhooks that notify Azure when code changes. Without these permissions, the integration fails, and understanding why is an important troubleshooting skill that the exam tests.

When you configure continuous deployment with a GitHub token, Azure creates a webhook in your repository automatically. This webhook sends an HTTP POST to Azure whenever code is pushed to the configured branch. The payload includes information about what changed, who made the change, and which commit triggered the webhook. Azure uses this information to pull the latest code and trigger a deployment. Understanding this webhook mechanism helps you troubleshoot scenarios where deployments aren't triggering as expected, which is a common exam question pattern.

Branch mapping is another important concept. Different deployment targets can map to different branches, enabling workflows where the main branch deploys to production and other branches deploy to staging or development environments. This branch-based deployment strategy is standard practice and appears throughout the exam. Understanding how to configure branch mappings and recognizing when they're appropriate is essential for answering scenario-based questions correctly.

## Deployment Slots

Deployment slots are heavily tested on the AZ-204 exam because they're the recommended approach for zero-downtime deployments in App Service. The fundamental concept is that each slot is essentially a separate application with its own hostname, configuration, and content. You deploy new versions to a staging slot, test them thoroughly without affecting production, and then swap the slots to make the new version live. This pattern eliminates downtime because the swap operation is nearly instantaneous and the new version is already warmed up and ready to serve traffic.

Understanding tier requirements is critical. Deployment slots require Standard tier or above. Free and Basic tiers don't support slots. The exam frequently tests whether you know which features require which tiers, and deployment slots are a common example. If a scenario describes the need for staging environments or zero-downtime deployments, your solution must include either Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier.

Slot configuration is an important exam topic. Each slot has its own application settings and connection strings, but you can mark specific settings as "slot settings" which means they stay with the slot during a swap rather than moving with the code. This is critical for scenarios where staging and production need different database connections or API keys. During a swap, slot-specific settings remain with their respective slots while non-sticky settings move with the code. Understanding this behavior is essential for designing proper deployment workflows and is tested extensively on the exam.

The swap operation itself has specific behavior that appears in exam questions. Before completing the swap, Azure warms up the target slot by sending requests to it. This initialization ensures that all application instances are ready to serve traffic before they start receiving production requests. The warmup eliminates cold start delays that could impact users. Understanding this warmup phase and why it's important helps you answer questions about application performance during deployments.

## Continuous Deployment Workflows

The exam tests your understanding of complete CI/CD workflows, not just individual components. A typical workflow involves developers pushing code to a feature branch, which triggers automated builds and tests. When the feature is ready, the code is merged to a staging branch, which automatically deploys to a staging slot. After testing and validation in staging, the code is merged to main, which deploys to production. Understanding this complete flow and being able to design it based on requirements is an important exam skill.

Auto-swap is an advanced feature that appears in exam scenarios. With auto-swap configured, successful deployments to a slot automatically trigger a swap to production. This provides fully automated continuous deployment where code changes flow from commit to production without any manual intervention. Understanding when auto-swap is appropriate and how to configure it is important for exam success. The key consideration is that auto-swap should only be used when you have comprehensive automated testing that validates deployments before swapping.

Rollback strategies using deployment slots are another exam topic. If you discover issues after a swap, you can swap back to the previous version immediately. The old version is still running in what's now the staging slot, so swapping back is just as fast as the original swap. This easy rollback capability is a major advantage of using deployment slots and appears in exam questions about disaster recovery and deployment safety.

## Configuration Management

Understanding configuration in the context of CI/CD is critical. Application settings and connection strings can be marked as slot-specific, which is essential for proper environment isolation. Your staging slot might connect to a staging database, while production connects to the production database. Marking these connection strings as slot-specific ensures they don't swap when you swap the slots, maintaining proper environment isolation even as code moves between slots.

The exam frequently presents scenarios where deployments work in staging but fail in production, and the cause is often configuration. Understanding configuration precedence, slot-specific settings, and how configuration flows through a swap operation helps you diagnose these scenarios correctly. This is a common pattern in exam questions because it tests multiple concepts simultaneously - you need to understand both deployment slots and configuration management to answer correctly.

## Branch-Based Deployment

Understanding branch mapping is essential for the exam. Production typically deploys from main or master branch. Staging slots deploy from staging or development branches. Feature branches might deploy to dedicated development slots for testing. This branch-based strategy provides clear separation between environments and enables multiple developers to work simultaneously without interfering with each other. The exam tests your ability to design these branch mappings based on requirements like "developers need to test features independently before merging to staging."

Understanding Git workflows in the context of Azure deployments is important. When you push to a monitored branch, Azure receives the webhook notification, clones the repository at that commit, runs the build process using Oryx or your configured build system, and deploys the resulting artifacts to the appropriate slot. Understanding this complete flow helps you troubleshoot scenarios where deployments fail or produce unexpected results.

## Common Exam Question Patterns

The exam frequently presents scenarios requiring you to design deployment workflows. "You need to deploy a web application with zero downtime. What should you use?" tests your understanding that deployment slots with swapping provides zero-downtime deployments. "Your staging environment is connecting to the production database after a slot swap. What's the issue?" tests your knowledge that connection strings should be marked as slot-specific to prevent them from swapping.

Questions about CI/CD automation are common. "You need to deploy automatically when code is pushed to GitHub. What should you configure?" tests your understanding of continuous deployment with GitHub token authentication and webhooks. "Your App Service plan is Basic tier but deployment slots aren't showing. Why?" tests your knowledge that slots require Standard tier or higher.

Troubleshooting questions appear frequently. "Deployments aren't triggering automatically when you push code. What should you check?" requires understanding webhook configuration, GitHub token permissions, and branch mappings. "After swapping slots, the new production slot is using staging database credentials. What's the problem?" tests your understanding of slot-specific settings and what configuration swaps versus what stays.

## Security Considerations

The exam tests security best practices for deployments. Personal Access Tokens should be kept secure and rotated regularly. Tokens with excessive permissions create security risks. Understanding the minimum required permissions for different scenarios is important. For continuous deployment, you need workflow and admin:repo_hook permissions. Understanding why each permission is necessary helps you answer questions about proper token configuration.

Deployment credentials come in two types: user-level and app-level. User-level credentials are per-Azure-account and work for all your apps. App-level credentials are per-app and can be reset independently. Understanding when to use each type and how they differ is important for the exam. Managed identities provide an even better approach for some scenarios, eliminating credentials entirely, and understanding when managed identities can replace traditional credentials is an advanced exam topic.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

The exam expects you to understand how to monitor and troubleshoot deployments. The Deployment Center in the Portal is the primary tool, showing deployment status, logs, and history. Understanding how to access detailed logs, interpret build output, and diagnose deployment failures is critical. The exam might present deployment error messages and expect you to identify the cause, which requires familiarity with common error patterns.

Kudu, accessible at app-name.scm.azurewebsites.net, provides advanced diagnostic capabilities. Understanding that Kudu exists and what capabilities it provides is important for exam questions about troubleshooting complex deployment issues. The site includes REST APIs, debugging consoles, and detailed environment information that can help diagnose issues that aren't obvious from the Portal.

## AZ-204 Exam Study Points

Let's consolidate the key points for exam success. Deployment slots provide zero-downtime deployments and easy rollback, but require Standard tier or higher. Understanding slot-specific settings and what swaps versus what stays is critical. Continuous deployment from GitHub requires Personal Access Tokens with workflow and admin:repo_hook permissions. Webhooks trigger automatic deployments when code is pushed to configured branches. Understanding manual versus continuous integration and when each is appropriate is essential.

Branch-based deployment strategies map branches to deployment targets, enabling workflows where different branches deploy to different slots. Auto-swap enables fully automated continuous deployment but should only be used with comprehensive automated testing. Configuration management in deployment slots requires understanding slot-specific settings and configuration precedence. Rollback is accomplished by swapping slots back to the previous version.

Understanding the complete deployment workflow from code push through build, deployment, warmup, and swap helps you answer complex scenario questions. Knowing how to troubleshoot common deployment issues and where to find diagnostic information is important for exam success. Security best practices including token management, credential types, and managed identities appear throughout the exam.

## Cleanup

When you're finished with these exercises, removing the resource group deletes everything including all App Service plans, web apps, deployment slots, and their configurations. Understanding resource lifecycle management is important not just for cost control but also because the exam tests proper resource management practices. Using the no-wait flag allows deletion to proceed in the background, demonstrating understanding of asynchronous operations in Azure, which is a concept that appears throughout the exam in various contexts.
