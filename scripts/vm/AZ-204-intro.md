Excellent work exploring VMs in the Portal and creating a Linux VM with the CLI, then connecting to the VM! Understanding virtual machines is important for the AZ-204 exam's compute and decision-making domains.

IaaS versus PaaS decision making is critical for the exam. You use VMs when you need complete control over OS and software, when running applications requiring specific OS configurations, when migrating legacy applications that can't be containerized, or when you need full administrative access. You prefer PaaS alternatives when you want to focus on application code rather than infrastructure, need automatic scaling and high availability, want built-in patching and maintenance, or are building cloud-native applications. The exam tests understanding of when VMs are appropriate choices.

VM creation and configuration using Azure CLI requires knowing az vm create with key parameters like resource group, location, VM name, image, size, and authentication options. The Portal workflow includes resource group selection, image and size selection, networking and disk configuration, and authentication setup. Both approaches appeared in your exercises, and the exam tests understanding of these creation processes.

Resource dependencies must be understood deeply. Virtual Networks provide network isolation and connectivity. Network Interfaces connect VMs to virtual networks. Network Security Groups provide firewall rules controlling traffic. Public IP Addresses enable optional internet connectivity. Managed Disks include OS disk and optional data disks. The exam tests understanding of these dependencies and whether they're created automatically versus manually.

VM sizes and performance require knowing different series. A-Series for entry-level development and test, B-Series burstable for variable CPU usage, D-Series general purpose with balanced CPU-to-memory, E-Series memory-optimized for databases, F-Series compute-optimized with higher CPU-to-memory ratio, N-Series GPU-enabled for machine learning. VM size affects CPU cores, memory, network bandwidth, disk throughput and IOPS, and cost. The exam tests choosing appropriate sizes for specific scenarios.

Storage and disks have distinct performance characteristics. Standard HDD offers lowest cost for backup, Standard SSD provides better performance for web servers, Premium SSD delivers high performance for production databases, Ultra Disk provides highest performance with sub-millisecond latency. You can attach multiple data disks, resize disks with increase only, take snapshots for backup, and encrypt disks. The exam tests understanding of disk types and operations.

Networking and security concepts include NSG rules configuring traffic by port number, protocol, source and destination, and priority where lower numbers are processed first. Standard ports include 22 for SSH, 3389 for RDP, 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS. Public IPs enable internet connectivity while Private IPs handle internal VNet communication with static versus dynamic allocation. Connectivity options include SSH for Linux, RDP for Windows, Azure Bastion for secure browser-based access, and VPN or ExpressRoute for hybrid connectivity. The exam tests network security configuration.

Managed Identities enable VMs to authenticate to Azure services without credentials in code. System-Assigned Managed Identity is created with VM and deleted when VM is deleted. User-Assigned Managed Identity is created independently and assigned to multiple VMs. This eliminates credentials in code, a security best practice tested on the exam.

VM availability and scaling includes Availability Sets protecting against hardware failures, Availability Zones protecting against datacenter failures, VM Scale Sets auto-scaling instances, and Load Balancers distributing traffic. Cost management involves VM size affecting cost, region pricing varying, Azure Hybrid Benefit reducing Windows costs, Reserved Instances saving up to 72 percent, and Spot VMs using spare capacity. Common scenarios test choosing between VM, App Service, Container Instances, AKS, Azure Functions, and Azure Batch.
