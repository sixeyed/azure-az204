# Virtual Machines - Windows: AZ-204 Exam Focus

Great work! This Windows VM lab is essential preparation for the "Implement Infrastructure as a Service Solutions" domain of the AZ-204 exam. While the exam emphasizes PaaS offerings, understanding IaaS with Virtual Machines remains a critical certification requirement.

## What We'll Cover

We'll examine how to provision Windows VMs using Azure CLI with the right size, image, and network configuration. You'll master VM image URN structure - understanding publisher, offer, SKU, and version components for finding and specifying Windows images.

We'll explore VM storage management including OS disks versus data disks, Standard versus Premium storage tiers, and the cost implications of disk storage even when VMs are deallocated. You'll understand VM sizing for Windows workloads and how to query available sizes with specific resource requirements.

The exam tests your knowledge of network security including NSG rules, port requirements (RDP on 3389 versus SSH on 22), and the networking resources Azure creates automatically alongside VMs.

You'll learn when to choose VMs versus PaaS alternatives - VMs are right when you need full OS control, have specific dependencies, or need specialized development tools. For most modern applications, the exam emphasizes PaaS solutions instead.

Master Windows VM provisioning, configuration, and storage management for the AZ-204!
