# Virtual Machines - Windows: AZ-204 Exam Relevance

## Exam Domain Coverage

This lab covers content relevant to the AZ-204 exam domain **"Implement Infrastructure as a Service Solutions"**. While the exam tends to focus more heavily on Platform as a Service offerings like App Service and Container Instances, Infrastructure as a Service with Virtual Machines is still part of the certification scope.

## Key AZ-204 Concepts Demonstrated

### VM Provisioning and Configuration

For the AZ-204 exam, you need to understand how to provision virtual machines using Azure CLI, PowerShell, or ARM templates. This lab demonstrates:

- Using `az vm create` commands to provision VMs programmatically
- Specifying VM configuration parameters including size, image, and network settings
- Understanding the difference between Windows and Linux VM requirements

The exam may test your knowledge of which parameters are required versus optional, and how to configure VMs for specific scenarios.

### VM Images and URN Structure

Understanding OS images is important for the exam. You should know:

- The structure of a URN: publisher, offer, SKU, and version
- How to query available images using `az vm image list` commands
- The difference between using a specific image version versus "latest"
- Common publishers like MicrosoftWindowsDesktop, Canonical, and RedHat

Exam questions might present a scenario where you need to select the appropriate image for a specific requirement.

### VM Storage Management

Storage is a key topic for AZ-204. This lab covers:

- The difference between OS disks and data disks
- Understanding disk SKUs: Standard versus Premium storage
- Using `az vm disk attach` commands to add storage to VMs
- The cost implications of disk storage even when VMs are deallocated

You may see exam questions about designing VM storage solutions for specific performance or persistence requirements.

### VM Sizing and Performance

The exam tests your ability to select appropriate VM sizes. This lab demonstrates:

- Querying available VM sizes with specific resource requirements
- Understanding VM size families (D-series for general purpose, F-series for compute-optimized, etc.)
- The resource differences between Windows and Linux VMs

Expect scenario-based questions where you need to recommend a VM size based on application requirements.

### Network Security and Access

Understanding VM network configuration is crucial for the exam:

- Network Security Groups and inbound/outbound rules
- Configuring public IP addresses and DNS names
- Understanding port requirements (RDP on 3389 for Windows, SSH on 22 for Linux)
- The network resources created alongside VMs (NICs, NSGs, VNets)

The exam may test your knowledge of how to secure VM access or troubleshoot connectivity issues.

## How This Differs from PaaS Solutions

While studying for AZ-204, it's important to understand when to use IaaS (Virtual Machines) versus PaaS solutions:

**Virtual Machines (IaaS)** are appropriate when:
- You need full control over the operating system and installed software
- Your application has specific OS-level dependencies
- You're migrating legacy applications to the cloud
- You need to install and configure specialized development tools

**App Service or Container Instances (PaaS)** are better when:
- You want Azure to manage the underlying infrastructure
- Your application is built using standard frameworks (Node.js, .NET, Python, etc.)
- You want built-in scaling, deployment slots, and CI/CD integration
- You want to minimize management overhead

The AZ-204 exam emphasizes PaaS solutions because they're recommended for most modern cloud applications. However, understanding VMs is necessary for scenarios where PaaS doesn't fit.

## Exam-Style Scenarios

Here are example scenarios you might encounter on the AZ-204 exam related to this content:

**Scenario 1**: Your organization needs to deploy a development environment that includes legacy tools not available in container images. Developers should be able to access the environment from anywhere and start/stop it as needed. Which solution should you recommend?

**Answer**: Create a Windows VM with appropriate size and configure it with RDP access. Use a data disk for persisting development files. Developers can deallocate the VM when not in use to minimize costs.

**Scenario 2**: You're creating VMs via Azure CLI and need to ensure you always use the most recent security-patched image. How should you specify the image?

**Answer**: Use "latest" as the version component in the image URN instead of specifying a specific version number.

**Scenario 3**: An application requires 32 GB of memory and high-performance storage. Which configurations should you specify?

**Answer**: Query for VM sizes with memoryInMb equal to 32768, and specify Premium_LRS for disk SKUs.

## CLI Commands for the Exam

Make sure you're familiar with these commands for the AZ-204 exam:

- `az vm create` - Provision a new virtual machine
- `az vm list-sizes` - Query available VM sizes in a region
- `az vm image list` - Find available OS images
- `az vm disk attach` - Add a data disk to a VM
- `az vm start/stop/restart` - Manage VM power state
- `az vm deallocate` - Stop and deallocate a VM to minimize costs
- `az vm delete` - Delete a virtual machine

The exam may present code snippets and ask you to identify errors or missing parameters.

## Cost Management Considerations

The AZ-204 exam includes questions about cost optimization. Key concepts from this lab:

- Deallocated VMs don't incur compute charges but still incur storage costs
- Premium disks are more expensive than Standard disks
- Larger VM sizes cost more per hour
- Using managed disks simplifies storage management
- Resource groups enable bulk deletion to avoid ongoing charges

You should understand how to design VM solutions that balance performance requirements with cost efficiency.

## Integration with Other Azure Services

While this lab focuses on standalone VMs, the AZ-204 exam may test your knowledge of how VMs integrate with other services:

- Using Azure Key Vault for storing VM credentials
- Monitoring VMs with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics
- Backing up VMs with Azure Backup
- Connecting VMs to Azure Virtual Networks for secure communication
- Using VM Scale Sets for auto-scaling VM instances

Understanding these integration points helps you design comprehensive Azure solutions.

## Summary

This Windows VM lab provides hands-on experience with IaaS concepts that appear on the AZ-204 exam. While the exam emphasizes PaaS solutions, understanding VM provisioning, configuration, and management is essential for the Infrastructure as a Service section.

Focus on understanding when VMs are the right choice, how to configure them properly, and how they compare to alternative compute options in Azure. The CLI commands and concepts demonstrated in this lab directly translate to exam questions about VM deployment and management.
