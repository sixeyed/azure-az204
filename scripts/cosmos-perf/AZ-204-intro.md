Excellent work optimizing Cosmos DB! Request Units and cost management are critical AZ-204 exam topics. Let's think about what the exam expects you to know from these exercises.

Request Units as the compute cost metric is fundamental to understand. Every operation including read, write, and query consumes RUs. Complex operations consume more RUs like queries with filters or writes to multiple indexes. Point reads where you get by ID and partition key cost exactly 1 RU. The exam tests understanding of what affects RU consumption and how to measure it in different scenarios.

Index policies and tradeoffs are heavily tested on the exam. Indexes improve query performance but increase write costs because every write updates indexes, and they also increase storage costs because indexes consume space. Default policy indexes everything which is good for unknown workloads. Selective indexing reduces write and storage costs but may slow specific queries. The exam tests when to customize index policies and understanding the consequences of your choices.

Data modeling impacts on RU consumption can be massive with costs differing by 10x or more. Individual documents versus nested structures affect query costs significantly. Aggregating related data in bulk documents reduces RU consumption for reads but increases document size and may complicate updates. The exam tests understanding of modeling tradeoffs and choosing patterns based on your access patterns.

Provisioning models need to be memorized for the exam. Standard provisioned has fixed RU per second allocation with predictable cost that can be low when idle and set at database or container level. Autoscale provides dynamic scaling between min and max RU per second which handles variable traffic but costs more than provisioned at constant load. Serverless means you pay per RU consumed with no provisioning required, limited to 5000 RU per second, and good for sporadic workloads. The exam tests when to choose each model based on workload characteristics.

Partition key selection effects on query costs are important to understand. Queries with partition key in WHERE clause are point queries that search only one partition with very low RU cost. Queries without partition key are cross-partition queries that search all partitions with high RU cost. The exam tests choosing partition keys that minimize cross-partition queries for common access patterns.

Point read optimization is the most efficient pattern in Cosmos DB. Fetching by ID and partition key costs only 1 RU regardless of size up to 100KB. If you can design access patterns around point reads rather than queries, you dramatically reduce costs. The exam tests recognizing when point read optimization is possible in application design scenarios. You should also understand RU measurement and monitoring, caching strategies with Redis, bulk document patterns, throughput sharing across containers, and common scenarios about troubleshooting performance issues, optimizing costs, and choosing appropriate provisioning models. Master Cosmos DB cost optimization for the AZ-204!
