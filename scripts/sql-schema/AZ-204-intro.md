Great work with database deployment! This topic supports several AZ-204 exam objectives across storage, security, and Azure services domains.

When you created a SQL Server, you reinforced the resource hierarchy understanding that the exam tests. Resource Group contains SQL Server which is a logical container not a VM, and the SQL Server contains multiple databases. The server name must be globally unique and becomes your-server.database.windows.net. The server itself has no compute cost, you only pay for databases within it. Databases inherit server-level authentication. Understanding this resource organization is critical for the exam.

Uploading the Bacpac file taught you about Azure Blob Storage for database operations which is frequently tested. The exam focuses on Shared Access Signatures that provide time-limited access to storage resources with specific permissions and duration. SAS tokens are a security best practice because they provide granular access without exposing storage account keys. You also saw that the structure of blob URLs includes the storage account name forming part of the public address. The exam may test understanding of these storage access patterns for database import and export operations.

When you imported the Bacpac into a new database, you learned about data tier applications that the exam covers. Bacpac files include schema and data, so you use these for backups, migrations, and creating complete database copies. Dacpac files include only schema, so you use these for version control and deploying schema changes in DevOps pipelines. You can import from a Bacpac to create a new database, and you can export to a Bacpac to backup an existing database. The exam tests understanding of when to use each file type.

The firewall configuration you did demonstrates defense-in-depth security that's heavily tested. Azure SQL has default deny blocking all access, requiring explicit allow configuration. Server-level rules apply to all databases. The special IP address 0.0.0.0 allows Azure services internal access for services like Azure App Service or Azure Functions to connect. IP-based rules restrict access to specific IP ranges for client applications. Virtual network rules provide better security than IP-based rules in production by allowing access only from specific subnets. The exam tests understanding of firewall configuration for database access scenarios.

Using the new database and the lab where you added data then exported a new Bacpac ties into migration scenarios that appear frequently on the exam. You can migrate on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database using Bacpac import. You can clone production database to create test environment by exporting and importing. You can move database between Azure regions for disaster recovery or data residency. You can restore database from backup using Bacpac files. Other migration options include Database Migration Service for live migrations with minimal downtime, transactional replication for continuous sync, and geo-replication for disaster recovery. The exam tests choosing the appropriate migration approach for given requirements, and understanding the CLI commands you used like az sql server create, az sql db create, az sql db import, az sql db export, az storage blob upload, and az storage blob generate-sas.
