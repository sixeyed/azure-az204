Great work exploring VM in the Portal, creating a Linux VM with a public DNS name, installing a web server on the VM, and managing stop and start operations! This content supports multiple AZ-204 exam objectives around compute, networking, and security.

Resource lifecycle management is tested extensively on the exam. VMs have dependencies on multiple resources including NICs, PIPs, NSGs, and disks. Resources can be managed independently or as a group. Deleting a VM doesn't automatically delete all associated resources unless configured to do so. PIPs can exist independently and be reassigned to different resources. This knowledge is crucial for exam questions about resource management and cost optimization, understanding which resources persist and continue costing money even after the VM is deleted.

Networking in Azure is a major exam topic. Public IP Addresses have two allocation types: dynamic means released when VM is deallocated, while static means retained regardless of VM state. DNS Names use Azure FQDN support for PIPs in format name.region.cloudapp.azure.com, remaining constant even when the underlying IP changes. Network Security Groups act as virtual firewalls with rule-based access control. Inbound rules control what traffic can reach resources with priority-based evaluation where lower numbers are processed first. The exam tests networking configuration and troubleshooting scenarios.

Infrastructure as Code concepts apply beyond this interactive lab. The exam expects understanding of how to script VM deployments using Azure CLI, the parameters needed for programmatic VM creation, and how to query and manage resources using CLI commands. These same concepts apply to ARM templates, Bicep, and SDKs, all tested on the exam.

Exam question patterns include scenario-based questions. You deploy a VM but cannot access the web application, and the answer involves checking NSG rules to ensure the appropriate ports are open. You need to ensure a VM's public IP doesn't change, and the answer involves setting PIP to static allocation. You want to stop paying for a VM but retain its configuration, and the answer is deallocate the VM, not just stop it. Resource management questions test understanding of correct operation order, which resources are automatic versus manual, and how to associate or disassociate resources.

Comparison with other compute options helps choose the right service. Use VMs when you need full OS control, running legacy applications, specific OS or software requirements, or lift-and-shift scenarios. Don't use VMs for simple HTTP-triggered workloads where Azure Functions is better, containerized applications where Container Instances or AKS is better, or when you don't need OS-level access where App Service is better. The exam tests ability to choose appropriate compute services.

Practical exam tips include knowing the CLI commands since the exam includes CLI questions, so practice commands for creating, managing, and querying VMs. Understand defaults, knowing what resources are created by default and what's optional. Think security first, always considering NSG rules and access control. Optimize costs by understanding billing implications of running, stopped, and deallocated VMs. Master networking concepts, being comfortable with public versus private IPs, static versus dynamic allocation, and DNS. The exam tests these fundamentals across many scenarios.

Hands-on practice provides value for performance-based questions where you create or modify VM configurations, troubleshoot networking, and write CLI commands. Related topics include VM Scale Sets for automatic scaling, Availability Sets and Zones, ARM templates, managed disks, VM extensions, and Azure Monitor integration. VMs represent foundational IaaS with concepts applying across all Azure services.
