# Virtual Machines - Web Server: AZ-204 Exam Relevance

## How This Lab Relates to AZ-204

The AZ-204 "Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure" certification exam requires you to understand how to implement and manage Azure compute resources. While containers and serverless options are increasingly popular, Virtual Machines remain a fundamental compute service you need to understand.

## Relevant Exam Objectives

This lab directly addresses several AZ-204 exam objectives:

### Implement IaaS Solutions
- **Create and configure VMs**: Understanding how to provision VMs using Azure CLI
- **VM networking**: Configuring public IP addresses and network security groups
- **VM management**: Starting, stopping, and deallocating VMs

### Implement Azure Security
- **Network Security Groups**: Configuring inbound and outbound security rules
- **SSH access**: Securing access to Linux VMs
- **Principle of least privilege**: Only opening necessary ports

### Develop for Azure Storage (Networking Aspects)
- **Public IP addressing**: Understanding dynamic vs. static allocation
- **DNS integration**: Using FQDNs for reliable resource access

## Key Concepts for the Exam

### Resource Lifecycle Management
The exam tests your understanding of how Azure resources work together. In this lab, you learned that:
- VMs have dependencies on multiple resources (NICs, PIPs, NSGs, disks)
- Resources can be managed independently or as a group
- Deleting a VM doesn't automatically delete all associated resources (unless configured)
- PIPs can exist independently and be reassigned

This knowledge is crucial for exam questions about resource management and cost optimization.

### Networking in Azure
Network configuration is a major topic in AZ-204. This lab covered:
- **Public IP Addresses**: Understanding the difference between dynamic and static allocation
- **DNS Names**: How Azure provides FQDN support for PIPs
- **Network Security Groups**: Acting as virtual firewalls with rule-based access control
- **Inbound rules**: Controlling what traffic can reach your resources

### Infrastructure as Code
While this lab used the CLI interactively, the exam expects you to understand:
- How to script VM deployments using Azure CLI
- The parameters needed for programmatic VM creation
- How to query and manage resources using CLI commands

These same concepts apply to ARM templates, Bicep, and SDKs - all of which are tested on the exam.

## Exam Question Patterns

Based on this lab's content, you might see exam questions like:

**Scenario-Based Questions**:
- "You deploy a VM but cannot access the web application. What could be the issue?"
  - Answer involves checking NSG rules

- "You need to ensure a VM's public IP address doesn't change. What should you configure?"
  - Answer involves setting the PIP to static allocation

- "You want to stop paying for a VM but retain its configuration. What should you do?"
  - Answer: Deallocate the VM (not just stop it)

**Resource Management Questions**:
- Questions about the correct order of operations when creating VMs
- Understanding which resources are created automatically vs. manually
- Knowing how to associate or disassociate resources

## Comparison with Other Compute Options

The exam will likely test your ability to choose the right compute service. Understanding VMs helps you answer questions about:

**When to use VMs**:
- Need full OS control
- Running legacy applications
- Specific OS or software requirements
- Lift-and-shift scenarios

**When NOT to use VMs**:
- Simple HTTP-triggered workloads (use Azure Functions)
- Containerized applications (use Container Instances or AKS)
- Don't need OS-level access (use App Service)

## Practical Exam Tips

1. **Know the CLI commands**: The exam includes CLI questions. Practice commands for creating, managing, and querying VMs.

2. **Understand defaults**: Know what resources are created by default when you create a VM, and what optional components you can add.

3. **Security first**: When given a scenario, always consider NSG rules and access control.

4. **Cost optimization**: Understand the billing implications of running, stopped, and deallocated VMs.

5. **Networking**: Be comfortable with concepts like public vs. private IPs, static vs. dynamic allocation, and DNS.

## Hands-On Practice Value

The AZ-204 exam includes performance-based questions where you might need to:
- Create or modify VM configurations
- Troubleshoot networking issues
- Write CLI commands to achieve specific outcomes

This lab gives you practical experience with these exact scenarios, making you better prepared for the hands-on portions of the exam.

## Related Topics to Study

To fully prepare for VM-related exam questions, also study:
- VM Scale Sets (for automatic scaling)
- Availability Sets and Availability Zones
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
- Managed disks and storage options
- VM extensions for automated configuration
- Integration with Azure Monitor and diagnostics

## Summary

While you may not deploy many VMs in modern cloud-native development, understanding them is essential for the AZ-204 exam. VMs represent the foundational IaaS offering in Azure, and the concepts you learn here - resource management, networking, security - apply across all Azure services.

The practical skills you've gained in this lab - using the CLI, troubleshooting connectivity, managing resources - are directly applicable to exam scenarios and real-world Azure development.
