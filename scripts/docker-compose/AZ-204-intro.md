Great work with multi-container orchestration! While Compose itself isn't heavily tested, the patterns you learned directly apply to Azure services on the AZ-204.

Container networking and DNS resolution is heavily tested on the exam. Containers in the same network can communicate using service names as hostnames through automatic DNS, while containers in different networks cannot communicate unless explicitly connected. The exam tests your understanding of when containers can reach each other and how to troubleshoot connectivity issues, exactly like you did when debugging the random number generator app where the web container couldn't find the API because of a DNS name mismatch.

Environment variables for configuration separate code from configuration, enabling the same image to run in multiple environments with different settings. This pattern appears constantly in Azure through App Service app settings, ACI environment variables, and AKS ConfigMaps. The exam tests configuration management patterns and how to externalize settings from container images, just like you saw when the Compose file used environment variables to configure the logging level for the API and the service URL for the web container.

Desired-state deployment is fundamental to Azure infrastructure. You declare what you want and the platform figures out how to achieve it, just like Compose compares current state to desired state and makes minimal changes. This concept translates directly to Azure Resource Manager templates, Bicep, and Kubernetes manifests. The exam tests understanding of declarative versus imperative approaches and when each is appropriate, building on what you experienced when you updated the Compose YAML and ran up again to see only the changed container get recreated.

Debugging container connectivity requires knowing how to check logs, test DNS resolution, verify network configuration, and understand why containers can't reach each other. The exam may present troubleshooting scenarios requiring exactly the skills you practiced when you used docker logs to see the API address the web container was trying to reach and nslookup to test DNS resolution between containers.

Azure Container Instances multi-container groups use the same patterns as Compose. Containers in a group share network namespace so they can communicate via localhost, share storage volumes, and start or stop together as a unit. The exam tests understanding of container groups, when to use them versus separate containers, and how shared resources work within a group, applying the same concepts you learned about Compose services and networks.

Azure Container Apps is a newer service that natively supports Docker Compose files for deployment. Understanding Compose syntax helps you answer Container Apps questions about service definitions, networking, and environment configuration. The same YAML patterns translate directly, so your experience reading Compose files with services, images, ports, and networks prepares you for Container Apps scenarios.

Azure Kubernetes Service uses similar concepts where pods work like Compose services, services provide networking like Compose networks, and ConfigMaps and Secrets work like environment variables. Your Compose knowledge transfers directly to Kubernetes questions about pod definitions, service discovery, and configuration management, especially the patterns around how containers in the same network communicate and how configuration gets externalized.

The exam also covers integration with Azure Container Registry for private images in Compose, Key Vault references for secrets management, Application Insights integration for monitoring distributed applications, networking patterns for service discovery including the lab scenario where you added Nginx to multiple networks to bridge between them, and common scenarios about multi-container architectures and troubleshooting. Master these multi-container patterns for the AZ-204!
