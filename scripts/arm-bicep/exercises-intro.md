We've covered Bicep as the modern evolution of ARM templates with cleaner syntax. Now let's deploy infrastructure using Bicep's more maintainable approach and see why it's becoming the preferred way to define Azure resources.

You'll start by looking at the reference documentation to understand Bicep's design philosophy and capabilities. Then you'll dive into Bicep syntax and deployments by creating a simple Bicep template for a storage account. The syntax is immediately more readable than JSON with less indentation and no need to quote field names everywhere. You'll deploy the template directly using the Azure CLI, which treats Bicep files the same as JSON ARM templates. Bicep templates have interactive parameter prompts which is nice for learning, and command-line parameter options which is better for automation. You'll also use what-if analysis to preview changes when modifying resource properties, which works identically to JSON ARM templates functionally but the Bicep source is easier to read and edit.

Next comes the really interesting part when you explore using the Bicep tools. You'll install the Bicep CLI and then decompile a complex JSON ARM template for a Linux VM into Bicep format. Watch as hundreds of lines of verbose JSON become much more concise readable Bicep code. The decompiled code includes warnings about potential issues because Bicep's compiler is smarter about detecting problems. You'll then edit the generated Bicep file to fix those warnings and implement static IP allocation, addressing the idempotency issue from the JSON version. This demonstrates Bicep's key advantage where it's easier to understand and modify than JSON.

After that, you'll work with evolving infrastructure specs by practicing incremental deployment. You'll add SQL Server resources to existing VM infrastructure using a Bicep file that describes both old and new resources together. When you deploy, Azure recognizes which resources already exist and makes no changes to them, creating only the new SQL Server components. This is incremental mode in action, adding to existing infrastructure without recreating everything.

The lab exercise challenges you to make the template more flexible by parameterizing settings that are currently hard-coded, specifically the SQL Database SKU and sample database schema name. This teaches you about making templates reusable across different scenarios. Finally, you'll look at cleanup procedures to understand how to properly remove resource groups when you're done. Let's deploy infrastructure with modern Bicep syntax!
