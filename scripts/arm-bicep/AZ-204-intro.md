Excellent work with Bicep! While the exam may not test Bicep syntax directly, understanding infrastructure as code concepts applies to both JSON and Bicep formats. Let's think about what the exam expects you to know from these exercises.

Infrastructure as code concepts are fundamental regardless of which format you use. Repeatability means you can deploy the same infrastructure multiple times consistently. Version control lets you track infrastructure changes in Git. Consistency eliminates manual configuration differences between environments. Documentation happens automatically because templates serve as living infrastructure documentation. The exam tests understanding of why infrastructure as code matters and when to use it versus manual deployment.

ARM template structure remains consistent between JSON and Bicep. Parameters define inputs, variables hold reusable values, resources declare infrastructure, and outputs return values for other templates or scripts. The syntax differs but the concepts are identical. The exam tests understanding of template structure regardless of format, so knowing Bicep actually helps you understand ARM template questions better because Bicep's cleaner syntax makes the relationships more obvious.

Deployment modes are critical to understand for the exam. Incremental mode is the default and adds or updates resources matching the template while leaving other resources in the group untouched. Complete mode removes resources not in the template, which is dangerous if you forget to include existing resources. The exam heavily tests when to use each mode and the consequences of choosing the wrong one, particularly in scenarios where you're updating existing infrastructure.

Parameterization and reusability enable using one template across multiple environments. Parameters handle environment-specific values like names, SKUs, and sizes. Variables contain calculated values derived from parameters. Conditional resources use if expressions to include or exclude resources. Loops create multiple similar resources without duplicating template code. The exam tests designing templates that work across dev, test, and production environments with different parameter values.

Resource dependencies are handled differently in Bicep versus JSON, which is interesting conceptually. Bicep has implicit dependencies where it automatically detects when resources reference each other. JSON requires explicit dependsOn arrays for manual dependency management. Understanding dependencies is important for exam questions about deployment order and troubleshooting circular dependencies where resources depend on each other in ways that can't be resolved.

What-if analysis for validation works identically with Bicep and JSON templates. The command previews changes showing creates, updates, and deletes. The exam tests when to use what-if and how to interpret its results, particularly for identifying configuration drift or validating template changes before deploying to production. You should also understand Bicep advantages like cleaner syntax, better type safety, and modules for reusability. Know that Bicep transpiles to ARM JSON before deployment, so fundamentally it's still using the ARM deployment engine. The exam includes common scenarios about troubleshooting templates and organizing infrastructure code with modules and parameter files. Master infrastructure as code for the AZ-204!
