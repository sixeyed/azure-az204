Great work! This container probes lab directly supports the Implement containerized solutions objective in the AZ-204 exam. Understanding container health monitoring is essential for developing production-ready applications in Azure Kubernetes Service.

We'll start by exploring the API specs to understand how container probes are defined in the Kubernetes API. The exam expects you to distinguish between the three probe types, so understanding how they're configured is crucial. When we work through self-healing apps with readiness probes, you'll see how readiness probes determine if containers are ready to receive traffic, removing pods from service endpoints when they fail. This is essential for maintaining service availability during partial failures.

The section on self-repairing apps with liveness probes shows how liveness probes determine if containers need restarting, killing and recreating pods when they fail. The exam tests your knowledge of when to use readiness versus liveness probes, so understand that failed readiness probes remove pods from endpoints immediately while keeping them running, whereas failed liveness probes trigger container restarts incrementing the restart count.

You'll explore the three implementation methods you need to understand. HTTP probes make GET requests expecting success status codes, perfect for REST APIs and web applications. TCP probes check if ports are accepting connections, ideal for databases and non-HTTP services. Exec probes run commands inside containers for custom health check logic. The exam may ask you to choose the appropriate probe type for different scenarios.

Throughout the lab, you'll work with probe configuration parameters including initialDelaySeconds for startup wait time, periodSeconds for check frequency, timeoutSeconds for response deadlines, failureThreshold for consecutive failures before action, and successThreshold for consecutive successes after failure. Know these parameters as the exam tests your ability to configure appropriate values for different application types.

In the lab challenge, you'll apply these concepts to a real application with reliability problems, configuring both probe types to create self-healing infrastructure. Finally, we'll do cleanup to remove resources properly. We'll cover Azure Kubernetes Service integration with probe failures appearing in Azure Monitor container insights, Application Insights for correlating probe failures with application telemetry, and Log Analytics for analyzing patterns. The exam includes best practices like always implementing health check endpoints that verify functionality, using both probe types in production, and designing health endpoints that check dependencies not just process existence. Master container probe configuration for the AZ-204!
