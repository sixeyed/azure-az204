Great work with Front Door! This topic spans multiple AZ-204 domains including security, integration, and Azure solutions implementation.

When to choose Front Door versus other Azure load balancing services is critical exam knowledge. Choose Front Door for global HTTP and HTTPS applications that need CDN capabilities, require WAF protection like you configured in the lab, want session affinity across regions, or need fast SSL termination at edge locations. Choose Application Gateway for regional load balancing within a single Azure region, when you need an AKS ingress controller, or when you don't need CDN functionality. Choose Azure Load Balancer for Layer 4 non-HTTP traffic like TCP or UDP, or for regional load balancing of any protocol. Choose Traffic Manager for DNS-based routing across global endpoints or when you need to route non-HTTP protocols. The exam heavily tests service selection with scenario questions asking which service best fits specific requirements.

Front Door architecture with profiles, endpoints, origins, origin groups, and routes forms a hierarchy you must understand from the lab. The profile is the top-level resource that can be Standard or Premium SKU like the Premium profile you created. Endpoints are the public URLs clients access using the azurefd.net domain or custom domains. Origin groups contain backend applications with health probe configuration and routing rules like weighting and priority, exactly like you configured with different weights for your two ACI containers. Origins are the actual backend servers whether they're ACI containers like in your lab, App Service instances, or custom servers. Routes map incoming requests to specific origin groups based on patterns, which is where you enabled compression. The exam tests understanding of this component hierarchy and how they work together.

Security features include WAF policies with managed rulesets where the Microsoft Default Rule Set provides OWASP threat protection and Bot Manager blocks malicious bots, both of which you added to your WAF policy. You can create custom rules for application-specific threats. WAF operates in prevention mode which actively blocks malicious requests like the SQL injection attacks you tested, or detection mode which only logs them without blocking. DDoS protection is built-in requiring no extra configuration. SSL and TLS management includes automatic certificate provisioning and renewal for both default and custom domains. The exam tests WAF configuration scenarios and troubleshooting blocked requests, building on your experience seeing 403 Forbidden responses when the WAF blocked attacks.

Performance optimization includes caching where Front Door edge locations cache content closer to users based on cache duration and vary headers. Compression automatically reduces bandwidth for text content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which you enabled in the route configuration. Routing methods include priority-based routing for active-passive failover scenarios, weighted routing for load distribution across multiple backends like you configured with container two getting three times more traffic than container one, latency-based routing to send users to the closest healthy endpoint, and session affinity for sticky sessions where a user consistently hits the same backend. The exam tests understanding of caching behavior including when content is cached and when it's bypassed.

Integration with containerized apps means Front Door works with ACI for containerized workloads like you deployed in East US and West US, AKS for Kubernetes clusters, App Service Web Apps for PaaS applications, and API Management for API frontends. The exam tests designing architectures that combine Front Door with these services for global content distribution and security, similar to the lab challenge where you added a Pi application to the same Front Door profile.

Troubleshooting common issues includes 502 Bad Gateway errors caused by unhealthy origins or misconfigured health probes that fail to reach backends properly. 403 Forbidden responses might indicate WAF blocking legitimate requests requiring rule tuning or exclusions, though in your lab they correctly blocked actual attacks. Caching issues stem from wrong cache durations or incorrectly configured vary headers causing stale content. SSL and TLS problems include certificate mismatches between the origin host header and actual certificate, or protocol version mismatches between Front Door and origins. The exam may present error scenarios requiring diagnosis.

The exam also covers CLI commands for creating profiles, endpoints, origins, routes, and WAF policies like you used in the lab, monitoring through diagnostic logs and metrics, cost optimization by understanding what drives Front Door costs like outbound data transfer and WAF rule evaluations, and common scenarios about implementing global applications, securing HTTP services from attacks, and troubleshooting connectivity issues. Master Front Door for the AZ-204!
