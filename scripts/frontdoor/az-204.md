# Azure Front Door - AZ-204 Exam Relevance Narration Script

## Introduction

Azure Front Door is an important topic for the AZ-204 exam. Understanding how to implement and configure Front Door falls under the domain of implementing Azure solutions, specifically focusing on how to implement secure cloud solutions and optimize Azure solutions.

Let's explore how Front Door relates to the AZ-204 exam objectives and what you need to know.

## Exam Domain: Implement Azure Solutions

Front Door appears in multiple areas of the AZ-204 exam content outline:

### Implementing Containerized Solutions

When you deploy containerized applications using Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service, you need a way to expose them globally with load balancing and security. Front Door is a key solution for this requirement.

You should understand how to configure Front Door with ACI endpoints, as we did in this lab. The exam may test your knowledge of setting up origins, origin groups, and health probes for containerized backends.

### Implementing App Service Web Apps

Front Door is commonly used as the global frontend for App Service applications. You should know how to integrate Front Door with Web Apps, including:

- Configuring custom domains
- SSL/TLS termination
- URL routing and path-based routing
- Session affinity for stateful applications

### API Management Integration

API Management is another common backend for Front Door. Understanding how to configure Front Door with APIM endpoints, including how to handle API versioning and rate limiting, may appear on the exam.

## Exam Domain: Implement Secure Cloud Solutions

Security is a major focus of the AZ-204 exam, and Front Door provides several security features you must understand:

### Web Application Firewall

You need to know how to:
- Create and configure WAF policies
- Apply managed rulesets (OWASP rules and Bot Manager)
- Configure WAF in detection vs. prevention mode
- Create custom WAF rules
- Associate WAF policies with Front Door endpoints

The exam may present scenarios where you need to choose the appropriate WAF configuration to protect against specific threats.

### DDoS Protection

Understanding that Front Door provides built-in DDoS protection at the network layer is important. You should know the differences between Azure DDoS Basic (included with Front Door) and DDoS Standard.

### SSL/TLS and Certificate Management

Know how to:
- Configure HTTPS endpoints
- Manage SSL certificates
- Configure end-to-end SSL/TLS
- Enforce HTTPS redirection

## Exam Domain: Optimize Azure Solutions

Performance optimization is another key exam area where Front Door is relevant:

### Caching and CDN

You should understand:
- How Front Door caching works
- Cache rules and cache behavior
- Query string caching behavior
- Compression options
- How to configure cache-control headers

### Load Balancing and Routing

Know the different routing methods:
- Priority-based routing for active-passive scenarios
- Weighted routing for traffic distribution
- Latency-based routing for optimal performance
- Session affinity for stateful applications

### Health Probes and Failover

Understand how to:
- Configure health probes with appropriate intervals
- Set thresholds for marking origins as unhealthy
- Design for automatic failover between regions
- Configure acceptable latency parameters

## Comparing Azure Load Balancing Services

The exam may test your ability to choose the right load balancing solution. You should understand when to use:

- Azure Load Balancer: Layer 4 load balancing for non-HTTP protocols, regional
- Application Gateway: Layer 7 load balancing with WAF, regional
- Traffic Manager: DNS-based global routing
- Front Door: Global load balancing with CDN and WAF for HTTP/HTTPS traffic

Know the key differentiators and when each service is appropriate.

## Key Commands and Operations

For the AZ-204 exam, focus on these CLI operations:

### Profile Management
```
az afd profile create
az afd profile show
az afd profile list
```

### Endpoint Management
```
az afd endpoint create
az afd endpoint show
az afd endpoint list
```

### Origin and Origin Group Management
```
az afd origin-group create
az afd origin create
az afd origin update
```

### Route Configuration
```
az afd route create
az afd route update
```

### WAF Policy Management
```
az network front-door waf-policy create
az network front-door waf-policy managed-rules add
az afd security-policy create
```

### Security Policy Management
```
az afd security-policy create
az afd security-policy update
```

## Common Exam Scenarios

Be prepared for scenarios like:

1. Migrating from Traffic Manager to Front Door for improved performance and security
2. Implementing geo-filtering to restrict access by region
3. Configuring custom domains with SSL certificates
4. Setting up origin groups with health probes and weighted routing
5. Applying WAF rules to protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks
6. Optimizing performance with caching rules
7. Implementing blue-green deployments using weighted routing
8. Troubleshooting Front Door routing issues

## Configuration Best Practices

Know these best practices for the exam:

- Use Premium SKU when you need WAF capabilities
- Configure appropriate health probe intervals (not too frequent to avoid overwhelming origins)
- Use compression to improve performance
- Configure proper cache durations based on content type
- Implement custom domains with managed certificates for production
- Use security policies to protect all endpoints
- Monitor Front Door metrics and logs for performance and security insights
- Configure alerts for health probe failures

## Integration Patterns

Understand common architecture patterns:

- Front Door with App Service for global web applications
- Front Door with API Management for global API distribution
- Front Door with AKS for containerized microservices
- Front Door with Storage for serving static content
- Front Door with multiple regional backends for high availability

## Troubleshooting

Be prepared to troubleshoot common issues:

- 502 Bad Gateway: Origin health issues or incorrect origin configuration
- 403 Forbidden: WAF blocking legitimate traffic
- Caching issues: Incorrect cache-control headers or cache rules
- SSL/TLS issues: Certificate configuration problems
- Routing issues: Incorrect route configuration or origin host header mismatch

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

Know how to:
- Enable diagnostic logs
- Monitor metrics in Azure Monitor
- Set up alerts for critical events
- Analyze access logs for security and performance
- Use Traffic Analytics to understand usage patterns

## Summary

For the AZ-204 exam, Front Door is a significant topic that intersects with multiple exam domains. Focus on:

- Understanding when to use Front Door vs. other load balancing services
- Configuring origins, origin groups, endpoints, and routes
- Implementing WAF for application security
- Optimizing performance with caching and compression
- Managing SSL/TLS and custom domains
- Troubleshooting common issues

Hands-on experience with Front Door, as you've gained in this lab, is the best preparation. Make sure you understand not just how to configure Front Door, but why you would choose specific settings for different scenarios.

This practical knowledge, combined with understanding the conceptual framework, will help you succeed on the AZ-204 exam.
