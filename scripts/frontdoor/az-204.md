# Azure Front Door - AZ-204 Exam Relevance

Azure Front Door is an important topic for the AZ-204 exam. Understanding how to implement and configure Front Door falls under the domain of implementing Azure solutions, specifically focusing on how to implement secure cloud solutions and optimize Azure solutions.

## Implementing Containerized Solutions

When you deploy containerized applications using Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service, you need a way to expose them globally with load balancing and security. Front Door is a key solution for this requirement. You should understand how to configure Front Door with ACI endpoints, as we did in this lab. The exam may test your knowledge of setting up origins, origin groups, and health probes for containerized backends.

## Implementing App Service Web Apps

Front Door is commonly used as the global frontend for App Service applications. You should know how to integrate Front Door with Web Apps, including configuring custom domains, SSL/TLS termination, URL routing and path-based routing, and session affinity for stateful applications.

## Secure Cloud Solutions

Security is a major focus of the AZ-204 exam, and Front Door provides several security features you must understand. You need to know how to create and configure WAF policies, apply managed rulesets including OWASP rules and Bot Manager, configure WAF in detection versus prevention mode, create custom WAF rules, and associate WAF policies with Front Door endpoints. The exam may present scenarios where you need to choose the appropriate WAF configuration to protect against specific threats.

Understanding that Front Door provides built-in DDoS protection at the network layer is important. You should know the differences between Azure DDoS Basic included with Front Door and DDoS Standard. Know how to configure HTTPS endpoints, manage SSL certificates, configure end-to-end SSL/TLS, and enforce HTTPS redirection for secure communications.

## Optimize Azure Solutions

Performance optimization is another key exam area where Front Door is relevant. You should understand how Front Door caching works, including cache rules and cache behavior, query string caching behavior, compression options, and how to configure cache-control headers properly.

Know the different routing methods: priority-based routing for active-passive scenarios, weighted routing for traffic distribution, latency-based routing for optimal performance, and session affinity for stateful applications. Understand how to configure health probes with appropriate intervals, set thresholds for marking origins as unhealthy, design for automatic failover between regions, and configure acceptable latency parameters.

## Comparing Azure Load Balancing Services

The exam may test your ability to choose the right load balancing solution. You should understand when to use Azure Load Balancer for layer 4 load balancing for non-HTTP protocols in regional deployments. Application Gateway provides layer 7 load balancing with WAF for regional applications. Traffic Manager offers DNS-based global routing. Front Door provides global load balancing with CDN and WAF for HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Knowing the key differentiators and when each service is appropriate is essential.

## Key Commands and Operations

For the AZ-204 exam, focus on these CLI operations. Profile management commands like az afd profile create, show, and list control Front Door profiles. Endpoint management uses az afd endpoint create, show, and list for managing access points. Origin and origin group management employs az afd origin-group create and az afd origin create for backend configuration. Route configuration uses az afd route create and update for traffic routing. WAF policy management includes az network front-door waf-policy create and managed-rules add. Security policy management uses az afd security-policy create and update for applying WAF protection.

## Common Exam Scenarios

Be prepared for scenarios like migrating from Traffic Manager to Front Door for improved performance and security. Implementing geo-filtering to restrict access by region. Configuring custom domains with SSL certificates. Setting up origin groups with health probes and weighted routing. Applying WAF rules to protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks. Optimizing performance with caching rules. Implementing blue-green deployments using weighted routing. Troubleshooting Front Door routing issues. These scenarios test your practical understanding of Front Door capabilities.

## Best Practices

Know these best practices for the exam. Use Premium SKU when you need WAF capabilities. Configure appropriate health probe intervals that aren't too frequent to avoid overwhelming origins. Use compression to improve performance. Configure proper cache durations based on content type. Implement custom domains with managed certificates for production. Use security policies to protect all endpoints. Monitor Front Door metrics and logs for performance and security insights. Configure alerts for health probe failures. These practices demonstrate operational excellence that the exam values.

## Integration Patterns

Understand common architecture patterns. Front Door with App Service enables global web applications. Front Door with API Management provides global API distribution. Front Door with AKS supports containerized microservices. Front Door with Storage serves static content globally. Front Door with multiple regional backends ensures high availability. These patterns appear frequently in exam scenarios.

## Troubleshooting

Be prepared to troubleshoot common issues. 502 Bad Gateway indicates origin health issues or incorrect origin configuration. 403 Forbidden suggests WAF blocking legitimate traffic. Caching issues stem from incorrect cache-control headers or cache rules. SSL/TLS issues involve certificate configuration problems. Routing issues result from incorrect route configuration or origin host header mismatch. Understanding how to diagnose and resolve these problems is essential.

## Practice Recommendations

For the AZ-204 exam, Front Door is a significant topic that intersects with multiple exam domains. Focus on understanding when to use Front Door versus other load balancing services, configuring origins, origin groups, endpoints, and routes, implementing WAF for application security, optimizing performance with caching and compression, managing SSL/TLS and custom domains, and troubleshooting common issues.

Hands-on experience with Front Door, as you've gained in this lab, is the best preparation. Make sure you understand not just how to configure Front Door, but why you would choose specific settings for different scenarios. This practical knowledge, combined with understanding the conceptual framework, will help you succeed on the AZ-204 exam.
