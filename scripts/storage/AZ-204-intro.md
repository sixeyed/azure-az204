Great work with Storage Accounts! This is one of the most heavily tested topics on the AZ-204 exam.

When you explored storage account options, you learned the fundamentals that must be memorized. Naming rules require globally unique names with lowercase letters and numbers only, between 3 and 24 characters, and invalid names are a common exam trap. Performance tiers include Standard using HDDs for most workloads and Premium using SSDs for low latency or high IOPS. Account kinds include General Purpose v2 which is the recommended default for most scenarios, Premium Block Blob for high-performance scenarios, and Premium File Share for file shares requiring premium performance. The exam tests choosing appropriate types based on requirements.

Creating a storage account showed you data redundancy options that are heavily tested. You must know all options and when to use each. LRS replicates three times within a single datacenter, lowest cost, protects against server rack and drive failures but not datacenter disasters, provides eleven nines of durability. ZRS replicates across three availability zones in primary region, higher availability than LRS, protects against datacenter failures, provides twelve nines of durability, but not available in all regions. GRS replicates to secondary region hundreds of miles away, provides disaster recovery, but secondary region data isn't accessible for reads unless you initiate failover, sixteen nines of durability. RA-GRS is same as GRS but allows read access to secondary region ideal for high availability read scenarios. GZRS and RA-GZRS combine ZRS in primary with GRS for highest durability and availability. The exam tests selecting appropriate redundancy for RTO and RPO requirements.

When you uploaded and downloaded blobs, you worked with blob container access levels that control security. Private access is the default and requires authentication with no anonymous access, this is the secure default for exam security scenarios. Blob-level access allows anonymous read access to individual blobs with exact URL but cannot list container contents. Container-level access allows anonymous read access to entire container with ability to list all blobs and is the highest level of public access. The exam frequently tests security scenarios where private is most secure. You also learned about blob storage access tiers that optimize costs based on usage patterns. Hot tier for frequently accessed data, Cool tier for infrequently accessed data stored at least 30 days, and Archive tier for rarely accessed data stored at least 180 days with rehydration taking hours.

The section on storage for VM disks taught you about managed versus unmanaged disks. Managed Disks are Azure-managed, easier to manage and scale, better availability, and no storage account limits. Unmanaged Disks require you to manage the storage account, stored as page blobs, limited by storage account IOPS, only use when you need specific storage control. The exam tests understanding when to use each option.

In the lab where you configured the storage account firewall, that demonstrated storage account security that's critical for the exam. Network security includes storage account firewalls restricting access by IP address or virtual network, service endpoints enabling private network access from Azure VNets, and private endpoints providing a private IP address in your VNet. Shared Access Signatures provide delegated access to storage resources with limited permissions, resource types, and time duration. Three types are User delegation SAS which is most secure using Azure AD credentials, Service SAS, and Account SAS. Access keys provide full access and should be rotated regularly and never embedded in client applications. Azure AD integration is the preferred authentication method for applications using managed identities with role-based access control.
