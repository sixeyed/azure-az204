# Azure Storage Accounts - AZ-204 Exam Introduction

Great work with Storage Accounts! This is one of the most heavily tested topics on the AZ-204 exam.

## What We'll Cover

**Storage account fundamentals** must be memorized. Naming rules require globally unique names, lowercase letters and numbers only, between 3 and 24 characters - invalid names are a common exam trap. Performance tiers: Standard uses HDDs for most workloads, Premium uses SSDs requiring low latency or high IOPS. Account kinds include General Purpose v2 (recommended default for most scenarios), Premium Block Blob (for high-performance scenarios), and Premium File Share (for file shares requiring premium performance). The exam tests choosing appropriate types.

**Data redundancy options** are heavily tested - you must know all options and when to use each. LRS replicates three times within a single datacenter, lowest cost, protects against server rack and drive failures but not datacenter disasters, provides eleven nines of durability. ZRS replicates across three availability zones in primary region, higher availability than LRS, protects against datacenter failures, provides twelve nines of durability, but not available in all regions. GRS replicates to secondary region hundreds of miles away, provides disaster recovery, secondary region data not accessible for reads unless you initiate failover, sixteen nines of durability. RA-GRS is same as GRS but allows read access to secondary region ideal for high availability read scenarios. GZRS and RA-GZRS combine ZRS in primary with GRS for highest durability and availability. The exam tests selecting appropriate redundancy for RTO and RPO requirements.

**Blob storage access tiers** optimize costs based on usage patterns. Hot tier is for frequently accessed data with higher storage costs but lower access costs. Cool tier is for infrequently accessed data stored at least 30 days with lower storage costs but higher access costs, used for short-term backup and disaster recovery. Archive tier is for rarely accessed data stored at least 180 days with lowest storage cost but highest access and rehydration costs taking hours, used for long-term backups and compliance archives. The exam tests matching tiers to access patterns.

**Blob container access levels** control security. Private access (default) requires authentication with no anonymous access - this is the secure default for exam security scenarios. Blob-level access allows anonymous read access to individual blobs with exact URL but cannot list container contents. Container-level access allows anonymous read access to entire container with ability to list all blobs - highest level of public access. The exam frequently tests security scenarios where private is most secure.

**Storage account security** is critical for the exam. Network security: storage account firewalls restrict access by IP address or virtual network, service endpoints enable private network access from Azure VNets, private endpoints provide a private IP address in your VNet. Shared Access Signatures (SAS) provide delegated access to storage resources with limited permissions, resource types, and time duration - three types are User delegation SAS (most secure using Azure AD credentials), Service SAS, and Account SAS. Access keys: every storage account has two keys providing full access that should be rotated regularly and never embedded in client applications. Azure AD integration is the preferred authentication method for applications using managed identities with role-based access control. The exam tests choosing appropriate security methods.

**Programmatic access patterns** are developer-focused. Azure Storage SDK available for multiple languages uses BlobServiceClient to interact with storage, BlobContainerClient for container operations, and BlobClient for individual blob operations. Connection strings should come from configuration, not hard-coded. Use managed identities instead of connection strings when possible. Implement retry policies for transient failures. The exam may test SDK usage patterns.

We'll cover **blob vs managed/unmanaged disks** (Managed Disks are Azure-managed, easier to manage and scale, better availability, no storage account limits - Unmanaged Disks require you to manage storage account, stored as page blobs, limited by storage account IOPS, only when you need specific storage control), **performance considerations** (IOPS limits, partitioning for scale, CDN integration), **best practices** (security first, cost optimization matching tiers to usage, availability based on RTO/RPO, monitoring with diagnostic logs), and **common scenarios** about storing user-uploaded images, retaining backup data, providing read access across multiple regions, and granting temporary access to external partners.
