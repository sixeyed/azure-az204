We've covered Azure Storage Accounts as a managed storage service providing highly available, secure, and scalable data storage with complete control over access and built-in redundancy options. Now let's work with storage accounts and blob storage hands-on.

We'll start by exploring storage account options in the portal where you'll search to create a new storage account and see all the configuration choices available. There's the globally unique naming with strict rules requiring 3 to 24 characters using only lowercase letters and numbers. You'll select a region which affects performance and pricing since data transfer costs vary by region. Performance levels include Standard which uses HDD for most workloads and Premium which uses SSD for low latency or high IOPS scenarios. Redundancy levels range from LRS for local redundancy to ZRS for zone-redundant to GRS for geo-redundant replication. Each option represents different trade-offs between cost, availability, and durability.

Next you'll create a storage account using the CLI with the storage account create command. You'll specify the SKU which combines both performance and redundancy into a single value like Standard_ZRS or Premium_LRS. Understanding this SKU naming is important because you can't just set performance and redundancy separately, they come as combined options. You'll create a blob container which is like a folder for organizing your blobs, and blob stands for Binary Large Objects which is essentially file storage optimized for unstructured data.

After creating your storage account, you'll upload and download blobs using both the portal and the CLI. You'll see how easy it is to upload files through the browser interface, and how the CLI gives you more automation options with commands to upload and download. Storage is not hierarchical at the container level, meaning you can't have containers inside other containers, but you can simulate folder structure by using forward slashes in blob names which creates virtual directories.

The next section on storage for VM disks shows you how to create a premium storage account specifically for unmanaged disks, then create a VM that uses this storage. VM disks are stored as page blobs in VHD format. While Azure uses managed disks by default today where Azure manages the storage account for you, unmanaged disks give you more control over storage configuration and let you manage VM disks alongside your other data in the same storage account. This lets you see the actual VHD files and understand how VM storage works under the hood.

For the lab challenge, you'll configure the storage account firewall to allow access only from your IP address while blocking the VM's access. This demonstrates defense in depth where you have multiple security layers rather than relying on a single control. You'll see how new blob containers default to private access as a security-first approach, and even with the blob URL, anonymous access is denied without authentication. When you're done, you'll clean up by deleting the resource group.
