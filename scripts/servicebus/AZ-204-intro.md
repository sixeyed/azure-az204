Great work with Service Bus! This is a critical component of the "Connect to and Consume Azure Services" domain, accounting for 20-25% of the AZ-204 exam.

When you were creating the Service Bus namespace and queue, you saw the different pricing tiers. The exam tests understanding of these tier differences. Basic supports queues only with 256 KB messages. Standard adds topics and subscriptions for pub-sub patterns, plus features like duplicate detection and transactions. Premium adds VNet integration, larger messages up to 1 MB, and dedicated processing capacity. You need to know which tier supports which features because the exam will give you requirements and ask you to choose the appropriate tier.

Running the .NET subscriber showed you point-to-point queuing patterns where each message is consumed by exactly one receiver. The exam really focuses on understanding FIFO ordering, which is guaranteed when you use sessions. Messages with the same SessionId are processed in order, which is critical for scenarios like customer orders that must be processed sequentially or multi-step workflows needing state tracking. The subscriber used the acknowledgment pattern by completing messages, and this ties into message settlement methods you need to memorize. Complete marks successful processing and removes the message from the queue. Abandon returns it to the queue and increments the delivery count. Dead-letter moves it to the DLQ as unprocessable. Defer saves it for later processing by sequence number.

The reliable and scalable messaging section demonstrated what happens when a subscriber goes offline and comes back. This relates to the exam's focus on dead-letter queue handling. Messages move to the DLQ when the max delivery count is exceeded, which defaults to 10, or when the message TTL expires with dead-lettering enabled, or when application code explicitly dead-letters them. The exam tests understanding of when and how to process the dead-letter queue to handle messages that couldn't be delivered or processed.

When you ran multiple subscriber instances and saw them share messages, that demonstrated the competing consumers pattern for horizontal scaling. This is different from topics and subscriptions which enable one-to-many communication where each subscription gets its own copy of matching messages. The exam presents scenarios where multiple components need to react to the same event, and you need to know that's when you use topics instead of queues.

In the lab where you explored multiple publishers and tested reliability without acknowledgment, that ties into understanding the message persistence model. Service Bus is different from Queue Storage in important ways the exam loves to test. Service Bus supports larger messages, FIFO guarantees with sessions, topics and subscriptions, duplicate detection that requires MessageId and must be enabled at creation, transactions for atomic operations, and dead-letter queues. Queue Storage has smaller 64 KB messages, no FIFO guarantee, no topics, but lower cost. The exam tests choosing between these services based on requirements, and also tests understanding of AMQP as the standard protocol that makes Service Bus interoperable with other messaging systems.
