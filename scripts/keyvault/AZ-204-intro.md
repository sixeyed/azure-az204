Great work with Key Vault! This is one of the most heavily tested security topics on the AZ-204 exam.

Securing application configuration data is the primary use case. Store connection strings, API keys, passwords, and certificates in Key Vault instead of config files or environment variables like you saw with the sql-password secret. The exam heavily tests knowing when to use Key Vault versus other configuration methods, especially scenarios where sensitive data needs encryption at rest and access auditing.

Azure SDK with DefaultAzureCredential is the modern approach for accessing Key Vault from code. DefaultAzureCredential tries multiple authentication methods in order including environment variables, managed identity, Visual Studio, Azure CLI, and interactive browser. This enables passwordless authentication with zero code changes between dev and production environments. The exam tests understanding of credential chains and troubleshooting authentication failures in different environments.

Managed Identities eliminate passwords entirely from your code. System-assigned identities are created with the resource, deleted with it, and have a one-to-one relationship. User-assigned identities are standalone resources that can be shared across multiple services and survive resource deletion. The exam heavily tests when to use each type and how to configure them with proper Key Vault access policies.

Secret versioning and rotation strategies are important for security. Reference secrets by name not version to automatically get the latest value when rotated like you practiced in the CLI. Set expiration dates to force rotation on a schedule. Use multiple versions during rotation to keep the old version briefly for gradual rollout. The exam tests designing rotation workflows that don't break running applications.

Access policies versus RBAC for permission management needs to be understood. Access policies are the traditional model with permissions per vault and granular control per operation like Get, List, and Set that you saw when creating the Key Vault. RBAC is the modern model using standard Azure roles consistent across services and easier to manage at scale. Key Vault supports both approaches. The exam tests choosing between them based on requirements.

App Service integration with Key Vault references uses special syntax @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...) in application settings. App Service automatically retrieves the secret value at startup without code changes. Changes to Key Vault require restarting the app to pick up new values. The exam tests this integration pattern for securing web app configuration.

Backup and recovery with soft delete prevents accidental deletion. Deleted secrets enter soft-delete state remaining recoverable for the retention period which defaults to 90 days. Purge protection prevents even admins from permanently deleting during retention. The exam tests understanding of recovery workflows and how to restore deleted secrets.

The exam also covers the distinction between secrets for sensitive strings, keys for encryption operations, and certificates for TLS like you explored in the lab challenge, network security with virtual network integration, audit logging for compliance, pricing tier differences between Standard and Premium, CLI commands for automation like you used throughout the lab, and common scenarios about secret rotation, troubleshooting access denied errors, and implementing zero-trust security patterns. Master Key Vault for the AZ-204!
