Great work with Resource Groups! While basic, this is foundational knowledge for all AZ-204 topics involving Azure resources.

When you created a new resource group in the portal, you saw how regions work. Each region is a collection of nearby data centers, and the region you choose for the resource group is where its metadata is stored. The exam tests understanding of the resource hierarchy which goes Management Group, then Subscription, then Resource Group, then individual Resources. Each level provides a boundary for organizing resources and applying governance, and Resource Groups are the most common scope for role-based access control, policies, and cost allocation.

Creating a resource group with the Azure CLI showed you the infrastructure as code approach. The exam really focuses on automated resource group creation using CLI with commands like az group create, PowerShell with New-AzResourceGroup, or declarative approaches using ARM templates or Bicep. You need to understand how resource groups fit into deployment pipelines and how they're provisioned programmatically rather than manually through the portal.

When you were managing resource groups using the list and query commands, that ties into exam topics about using JMESPath queries for filtering. More importantly, it relates to cost management using tags. You added tags to your resource groups, and tags like CostCenter or Environment help attribute costs and organize resources at scale. Here's a critical point the exam loves to test: tags on resource groups do not automatically inherit to the resources inside them. You must tag resources separately if you need that level of tracking.

The section on deleting resource groups is crucial for the exam because it tests understanding of cascading deletion behavior. When you delete a resource group, all contained resources are automatically deleted too. This is convenient for cleanup but dangerous if you accidentally delete the wrong group. The exam will give scenarios where you need to prevent this, which is where resource locks come in. You can apply CanNotDelete or ReadOnly locks at the resource group level, and those locks inherit to all resources inside, protecting production resources from accidental changes.

The lab where you figured out how to delete multiple groups with one command ties into understanding CLI scripting and automation patterns. This also relates to Azure RBAC at the resource group level, because permission inheritance means granting someone the Contributor role on a resource group automatically gives them Contributor on all resources within it. The exam tests both the benefits of this simplified permission management and the security implications of inheritance.

Throughout this, remember that the CLI commands follow a consistent pattern with verbs like create, list, show, delete, and exists. The exam may present scenarios where you need to choose the right command or understand what parameters are required for different operations.
