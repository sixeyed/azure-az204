# App Service for Static Web Apps - AZ-204 Exam Relevance

## Exam Overview

This lab directly addresses multiple objectives within the AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure certification exam. Understanding how to deploy and manage static web applications is a critical skill for Azure developers.

## Primary Exam Objectives Covered

### 1. Implement Azure App Service Web Apps (15-20% of exam)

This is one of the core domains of the AZ-204 exam, and this lab touches on several key skills:

**Create and configure Azure App Service**
- Understanding different App Service deployment models
- Creating App Service Plans and understanding their role
- Choosing appropriate pricing tiers (F1, B1, S1, etc.)
- Understanding OS choices (Windows vs. Linux)

**Deploy Azure App Service Web Apps**
- Using `az webapp up` for rapid deployment
- Understanding ZIP deployment mechanisms
- Deploying from local filesystems vs. source control
- Configuring runtime stacks (Node.js, .NET, etc.)

### 2. Azure Static Web Apps

While Static Web Apps is a newer service, it's increasingly relevant for modern web development patterns:

**Understanding Static Web Apps architecture**
- Recognizing when Static Web Apps is the appropriate choice
- Understanding the Git-based deployment model
- Working with GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Comparing Static Web Apps to traditional App Service

**Deploying Static Web Apps**
- Using `az staticwebapp create` command
- Configuring branch and app location
- Authenticating with GitHub
- Understanding automatic workflow creation

### 3. Implement Authentication and Authorization (15-20% of exam)

The lab challenge directly addresses authentication objectives:

**Implement authentication**
- Configuring identity providers in App Service
- Integrating Azure AD authentication
- Understanding Easy Auth (App Service Authentication)
- Accessing authentication details in application code

**Secure app data and services**
- Protecting endpoints with authentication requirements
- Understanding authentication flow in web applications
- Working with user identity information

## Secondary Exam Objectives

### Source Control Integration

**GitHub integration**
- Forking repositories
- Working with Git remotes
- Understanding continuous deployment from source control
- Managing GitHub Actions workflows

This demonstrates knowledge of DevOps practices, which appear throughout the exam.

### Azure CLI Proficiency

The exam expects you to be comfortable with:
- `az group` commands for resource management
- `az webapp` commands for App Service operations
- `az staticwebapp` commands
- `az appservice plan` commands
- Using help text and documentation effectively

### Resource Management

**Resource Groups and organization**
- Creating and managing Resource Groups
- Using tags for organization
- Understanding resource relationships (App Service Plan -> App Service)
- Resource cleanup and lifecycle management

## Exam Question Types You'll Be Prepared For

### Scenario-Based Questions

**Example scenario:** "A company has a Single Page Application built with React. The application has no backend logic and consists only of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The company wants the most cost-effective solution with automatic deployment when developers push code. Which Azure service should you recommend?"

**Answer:** Azure Static Web Apps - because it's optimized for SPAs, deploys from Git, includes free tier options, and has built-in CI/CD.

### Command-Based Questions

**Example question:** "You need to deploy a static HTML website to Azure App Service using the Azure CLI. The site files are in the current directory. Which command should you use?"

**Answer:** `az webapp up -g <resource-group> --html --sku F1 -n <app-name>`

### Configuration Questions

**Example question:** "You deployed a Node.js application to App Service, but the /user endpoint returns undefined for authentication details. What should you configure in the Azure Portal?"

**Answer:** Add an identity provider in the Authentication/Authorization settings.

## Key Concepts to Master

### Decision-Making Framework

The exam will test your ability to choose the right service:

**Use Static Web Apps when:**
- Application is pure static content or SPA
- Want Git-integrated deployment
- Need staging environments from pull requests
- Want simplicity without App Service Plan management

**Use App Service when:**
- Need more deployment flexibility
- Require full App Service management features
- Running mixed static/dynamic content
- Need to share App Service Plan across multiple apps

### Cost Optimization

Understanding the cost implications:
- Static Web Apps have a generous free tier
- App Service requires a plan, even for static content
- Multiple apps can share an App Service Plan
- Free tier (F1) vs. Basic tier tradeoffs

### Deployment Models

Being able to explain:
- Push deployment (webapp up, ZIP deployment)
- Pull deployment (Git integration, GitHub Actions)
- Continuous vs. manual deployment
- Local filesystem vs. source control repository

## Hands-On Skills Verified

This lab verifies you can:

1. **Create resources using Azure CLI** - Essential for exam scenarios that provide command-line interfaces
2. **Configure Git remotes** - Shows understanding of source control workflows
3. **Navigate Azure Portal** - Many exam questions reference Portal-based tasks
4. **Troubleshoot deployment issues** - The Node.js runtime matching requirement tests your problem-solving skills
5. **Configure authentication** - A critical security skill tested throughout the exam

## Study Tips for This Domain

1. **Practice the commands** - Memorize the key parameters for `az webapp up` and `az staticwebapp create`
2. **Understand the resource model** - Know what resources are created and why
3. **Compare and contrast** - Be able to explain when to use each service
4. **Know the authentication flow** - Understand how Easy Auth works without code changes
5. **Explore the Portal** - Many exam questions assume Portal familiarity

## Related Topics to Study

To fully master this exam domain, also study:

- **App Service deployment slots** - For staging and production deployments
- **App Service scaling** - Vertical and horizontal scaling options
- **Custom domains and SSL** - Configuring custom domains, managed certificates
- **App Service diagnostics** - Log streaming, application insights
- **Deployment Center** - Configuring various deployment sources
- **Configuration settings** - App settings, connection strings, environment variables

## Practice Questions

After completing this lab, you should be able to answer:

1. What resources are created when you run `az staticwebapp create`?
2. What file does Azure create in your GitHub repository for Static Web Apps?
3. What's the difference between `--html` and `--runtime NODE:16LTS` in webapp up?
4. How do you deploy multiple apps to the same App Service Plan?
5. Where do you configure authentication for an App Service Web App?
6. What happens when you push changes to a GitHub repository linked to a Static Web App?

## Conclusion

This lab provides essential hands-on experience with App Service and Static Web Apps that directly translates to exam success. The skills you've practiced - CLI commands, Portal navigation, authentication configuration, and deployment troubleshooting - are all tested in the AZ-204 exam.

Remember that the exam emphasizes not just "how" to do things, but "when" and "why" - understanding which service to use in different scenarios is just as important as knowing the commands to deploy them.
