We've covered Azure authentication and how Microsoft accounts provide access to Azure Subscriptions, with one account potentially having permissions across multiple Subscriptions. Now let's explore the three ways to interact with Azure.

We'll start by exploring the Azure Portal where you'll browse to portal.azure.com and sign in with your Microsoft account. In a corporate environment your account would be managed for you, but you can create your own personal account and use Azure for your own purposes. You'll open the All Services view which is where you can see everything in Azure, and there really is a lot there. You'll find the Subscriptions service to see all the Subscriptions you have access to, each with a unique ID. Then you'll explore creating resources like Virtual Machines to see what sort of configuration settings you need to specify. You can also browse to the Quickstart Center to see reference architectures. The portal is a great way to browse Azure services and explore resources, but it doesn't give you a repeatable, automatable experience.

Next you'll use the Azure CLI, which is the recommended tool for interacting with Azure. It's one of the first to be updated with new features and services, it has integrated help, you can use it for creating and managing resources, and it's cross-platform and easy to script in CI/CD pipelines. You'll run the az command to see how the integrated help works, upgrade to make sure you have the latest version, and then login to Azure. Once you're logged in, you'll use the command line to list all the accounts you have access to, experimenting with different outputs to find the most user-friendly. You'll see options like JSON which is the default, YAML for nested structures, table for human-readable columns, and TSV for tab-separated values. Each Subscription has a unique ID, and you'll notice fields like CloudName which represents which Azure cloud you're using.

Then you'll explore the Azure Shell, which is useful when you want to use Azure tools but can't install the CLI locally. You can use the Azure Cloud Shell which is a web interface that gives you a terminal session with Azure tools installed and configured. When you browse to shell.azure.com, you can choose between PowerShell or Bash for your terminal, and the shell session uses Azure storage to persist files and command history. The az command line is already installed, so you can run commands like account list immediately. You're already signed in because you authenticated with the portal. The cloud shell has lots of tools pre-installed, which you can discover by exploring with the command line.

For the lab challenge, you'll see what you can do with the Cloud Shell by creating a new .NET console project using dotnet new, uploading a C# source file to the project directory, and running it entirely in the cloud. This shows how the Cloud Shell gives you a complete development environment in the browser.
