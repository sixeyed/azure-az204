Excellent work with Azure access methods! Understanding authentication and interaction approaches is foundational for the AZ-204 certification.

When you were exploring the Azure Portal, you saw the visual interface for browsing services and understanding what configuration options are available. The exam tests your understanding of Azure account management and the hierarchy of how things are organized. One Microsoft account can have access to multiple Subscriptions, and each Subscription is a logical container with its own billing and access management. Tenants represent Azure Active Directory instances. Authentication proves your identity, while authorization determines which resources you can access. Understanding this hierarchy is fundamental for the exam.

Using the Azure CLI is where the exam really focuses because the CLI is the primary tool you'll use throughout. Azure CLI proficiency is critical because you'll need it for creating App Services, managing Container Instances and AKS, configuring Azure Functions, setting up storage accounts and Cosmos DB, managing API Management, and configuring Key Vault. Being comfortable with az commands and their structure is crucial for exam success. The pattern is consistent: az, then the group, then the subgroup, then the command, then the parameters. So you have patterns like az webapp create, az storage account create, and az functionapp create.

When you experimented with different output formats, that demonstrated output formatting capabilities the exam may test. Table format is for human reading with aligned columns. JSON is the default and is for programmatic parsing and detailed information. TSV is for simple scripting with tools like awk. You also have the query format with the query flag that extracts specific values using JMESPath. The exam may present scenarios where you need to parse CLI output for scripts or extract specific information.

The Azure Shell section showed you Cloud Shell capabilities which provide browser-based access. The exam may present scenarios where Cloud Shell is the appropriate tool choice. Pre-installed tools include Azure CLI, PowerShell, .NET SDK, Python, Git, kubectl, and more. Persistent storage maintains files and history across sessions, which is set up the first time you use it. The key advantage is automatic authentication which eliminates the need for az login because you're already signed in through the portal.

In the lab where you created a .NET console project and ran it in Cloud Shell, that demonstrated how Cloud Shell gives you a complete environment without needing to install anything locally. This ties into exam themes about automation and repeatability. The CLI enables scriptable operations for CI/CD pipelines, repeatable deployments with infrastructure as code, version-controlled resource definitions, and consistent environments across dev, test, and production. The exam tests understanding of when automation is appropriate versus manual portal operations, and how to integrate with DevOps pipelines using Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions.
