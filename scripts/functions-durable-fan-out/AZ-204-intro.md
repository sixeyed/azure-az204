Excellent work with parallel orchestration! The fan-out/fan-in pattern is heavily tested on the AZ-204 for scenarios requiring parallel aggregation.

Distinguishing between all five patterns with specific focus on fan-out/fan-in is crucial. This pattern uses Task.WhenAll to call multiple activities in parallel, waits for all to complete, then aggregates results like you saw with the three supplier quotes. Key difference from chained pattern is that operations execute simultaneously, not sequentially. The exam tests recognizing when parallel execution with aggregation is needed, building on scenarios like your quote engine where you needed to compare prices from multiple suppliers.

Task.WhenAll for parallel execution is the core technique. Create multiple tasks by calling activities, pass the array to Task.WhenAll, and await completion. All activities execute in parallel so total time equals the slowest operation, which is why your three 10-second supplier calls completed in about 10 seconds total instead of 30 seconds. The exam tests understanding that Task.WhenAll doesn't execute sequentially like multiple awaits would, and calculating execution times for parallel operations.

HTTP management APIs return status URLs for tracking orchestrations. The statusQueryGetUri lets you check status like you did to see the quote result, sendEventPostUri allows sending events to running orchestrations, terminatePostUri enables cancellation, and purgeHistoryDeleteUri cleans up completed orchestration data. The exam tests which URL to use for different operations and understanding the HTTP-based management pattern that enables async APIs.

Performance benefits are dramatic. Ten parallel operations that each take 10 seconds complete in 10 seconds total, not 100 seconds, exactly like your three supplier calls. This pattern is essential for scenarios like calling multiple external APIs to get quotes, processing multiple files simultaneously, or aggregating data from multiple sources. The exam tests calculating execution time and recognizing performance optimization opportunities where fan-out can dramatically reduce latency.

Retry policies for resilience in parallel operations need independent configuration. Each activity can have its own retry policy, so if one supplier times out you can retry it without affecting the other supplier calls. The exam tests configuring retries for fan-out scenarios where some operations may fail but others should continue, ensuring you get results from at least the successful operations.

Comparing to Logic Apps helps understand when to use each. Durable Functions offers a code-first approach better for complex logic like your quote selection algorithm, runs in Azure Functions with consumption or premium plans. Logic Apps provides a visual designer better for simple workflows, with many connectors for integration scenarios. The exam tests choosing the right tool based on requirements like developer skill set, complexity, and integration needs.

The exam also covers scaling considerations since fan-out creates many simultaneous executions that can hit service limits, cost implications of parallel processing, common anti-patterns like fanning out to thousands of activities which can overwhelm storage, and scenarios about parallel data processing, aggregating external API calls like your supplier quotes, and implementing map-reduce patterns. Master parallel orchestration for the AZ-204!
