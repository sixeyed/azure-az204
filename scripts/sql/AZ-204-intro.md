Great work with Azure SQL! This is essential knowledge for the AZ-204 exam's data storage domain.

When you were exploring Azure SQL in the portal, you saw the different service options that the exam tests heavily. SQL Database as PaaS is for new cloud-native applications with automatic updates, backups, and high availability. It's great for variable or unpredictable workloads with the serverless tier that automatically pauses when inactive, and multi-tenant SaaS applications can use elastic pools to share resources. SQL Managed Instance is for migrating from on-premises SQL Server with near 100% compatibility, supporting features like SQL Server Agent, cross-database queries, linked servers, and VNet integration. SQL Virtual Machines give you complete control with OS-level access for minimal-change migrations and features not available in PaaS. The exam presents scenarios and you need to choose the appropriate option.

Creating a SQL Server with the CLI demonstrated the resource hierarchy that you must memorize. Resource Group contains SQL Server, which is a logical container not a VM, and that SQL Server contains multiple databases. The server name must be globally unique and becomes your-server.database.windows.net. The server itself has no compute cost, you only pay for databases within it. Databases inherit server-level authentication, so one set of admin credentials works for all databases on that server. Deleting a server deletes all its databases, and deleting a resource group deletes everything inside. The exam tests understanding of this hierarchy and the cascade behavior.

When you created a SQL database, you saw the service tiers and compute options that appear frequently on the exam. Basic tier offers 5 DTU max for small workloads. Standard provides up to 3000 DTUs for medium workloads. Premium delivers up to 4000 DTUs for high-performance needs. General Purpose tier offers 2-80 vCores with balanced performance. Business Critical provides 2-80 vCores with low latency and high availability. Hyperscale supports databases up to 100TB. The serverless compute option bills per second for compute used. The exam tests choosing appropriate tiers based on requirements.

Connecting to the database showed you authentication methods and network security that are critical for the exam. SQL Authentication uses username and password stored in SQL Server, works across all network boundaries, and is the default for Azure SQL. Azure Active Directory Authentication integrates with Azure AD, supports multi-factor authentication, provides centralized identity management, and can use managed identities from applications, which is the best practice for production. When you hit the firewall error, that demonstrated how Azure SQL has a default-deny firewall requiring explicit access configuration. Server-level firewall rules apply to all databases on the server and are configured in Portal or CLI. Database-level firewall rules apply to specific databases via T-SQL. Virtual Network rules allow access from specific Azure VNets. The exam may present connection failures requiring firewall configuration.

When you queried the database, you used standard connection strings that follow formats the exam may test. ADO.NET format includes the server with fully qualified domain name and port 1433, Initial Catalog for database name, User ID and Password for SQL authentication, Encrypt=True for SSL/TLS, and Connection Timeout. Best practice is to store connection strings in Azure Key Vault, App Service Application Settings, or Azure App Configuration, never hardcoded in application code.

In the lab where you deleted the database and explored recovery, that relates to backup and recovery capabilities the exam covers. Azure SQL provides automatic backups with full backups weekly, differential backups every 12-24 hours, and transaction log backups every 5-10 minutes. Default retention is 7 days, extendable to 35 days, with long-term retention up to 10 years. Point-in-time restore can restore to any point within retention period, creates a new database, and can restore deleted databases within retention. The exam tests understanding of these recovery capabilities.
