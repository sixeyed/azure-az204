# API Management: Mocking New APIs - AZ-204 Exam Relevance

## AZ-204 Exam Objective

This lab directly supports the AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure certification, specifically under the objective:

**Implement API Management**

## Key Exam Topics Covered

### 1. API Management Service

Understanding how to work with Azure API Management is a core requirement for the AZ-204 exam. This lab demonstrates creating and configuring APIs in APIM, understanding the APIM service structure, working with API products and subscriptions, and managing API access through subscription keys.

### 2. API Design and Operations

The exam expects you to understand how to define API operations including GET, POST, and DELETE methods. You need to know how to work with URL paths and template parameters, define request and response schemas, and use HTTP status codes appropriately - knowing when to return 200 for success, 201 for creation, 204 for successful deletion, and 404 for not found. This lab covers all of these through hands-on practice with a student management API.

### 3. Policies in API Management

A crucial APIM concept tested in the exam is policy management. You need to understand inbound processing policies, how to implement the mocked-response policy, when and why to use mock responses, and how to apply policies to specific operations.

### 4. API Testing and Consumption

The exam may test your knowledge of how APIs are consumed by clients, authentication mechanisms like subscription keys, testing APIs with standard tools, and understanding API request and response patterns.

### 5. REST API Principles

The AZ-204 exam assumes foundational knowledge of REST APIs. You should understand resource-based URL design like /students and /students/{id}, appropriate use of HTTP methods with GET for retrieval, POST for creation, and DELETE for removal. You need to know status code meanings with 2xx indicating success and 4xx indicating client errors. JSON is the standard data format for API payloads.

## Practical Exam Scenarios

You might encounter exam questions about:

### Scenario 1: Mock Response Policy

"A development team needs to test their application against an API that hasn't been implemented yet. Which APIM policy should you use?"

Answer: The mocked-response policy allows you to return predefined responses without calling a backend service.

### Scenario 2: API Products and Subscriptions

"How do you control access to APIs in Azure API Management?"

Answer: APIs are added to products, and consumers subscribe to products to receive subscription keys for authentication.

### Scenario 3: API Definitions

"What format does APIM use for defining API request and response schemas?"

Answer: APIM uses JSON Schema definitions, which can reference other definitions using the $ref syntax.

### Scenario 4: Testing APIs

"Which HTTP header is used to authenticate requests to an APIM-hosted API?"

Answer: The Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header contains the subscription key for authentication.

## Real-World Application

Beyond the exam, this lab teaches skills you'll use in production scenarios:

### Enable Parallel Development

In real projects, frontend and backend teams often work simultaneously. Mock APIs allow frontend teams to start development immediately without waiting for backend implementation, reducing overall project timelines.

### API-First Design

Modern development favors designing APIs before implementing them. This ensures clear contracts between services, agreement on data structures and operations, better collaboration between teams, and reduced integration issues.

### Contract Testing

Mock APIs serve as the source of truth for API contracts. Teams can validate that implementations match specifications, test error scenarios like 404 responses, verify data structures and types, and ensure consistent behavior across the system.

## Exam Preparation Tips

To prepare for APIM-related questions on the AZ-204 exam, understand the full lifecycle of API management including design, publish, secure, and analyze phases. Know the different types of policies and when to use them. Practice creating APIs both manually and by importing specifications. Understand how products, APIs, operations, and subscriptions relate to each other in the APIM hierarchy. Be familiar with OpenAPI and Swagger specifications and how APIM uses them for API definitions.

## Additional Study Areas

While this lab focuses on mocking, the AZ-204 exam also covers backend integration by connecting APIM to real services, advanced policies like rate limiting, transformation, and caching, API versioning and revision strategies, developer portal configuration, monitoring and analytics, and integration with Azure Active Directory for authentication.

## Practice Questions

Consider these scenarios for additional practice. How would you export an API specification from APIM to share with consumers? What happens if a client makes a request without a valid subscription key? How would you version this API to support breaking changes? What policy would you add to limit the number of requests per minute? How could you transform the response to add additional fields?

## Summary

This lab provides hands-on experience with API Management concepts that are directly tested in the AZ-204 exam. The skills you've practiced - creating APIs, defining schemas, implementing policies, and testing with real tools - are all essential for both the exam and real-world Azure development.

Remember: The AZ-204 exam focuses on practical skills. Understanding how to actually implement these solutions in the Azure Portal and with Azure CLI/PowerShell is more important than memorizing facts.

Keep practicing, and good luck with your AZ-204 certification!
