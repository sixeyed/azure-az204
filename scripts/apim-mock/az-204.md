# API Management: Mocking New APIs - AZ-204 Exam Relevance

## AZ-204 Exam Objective

This lab directly supports the AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure certification, specifically under the objective:

**Implement API Management**

## Key Exam Topics Covered

### 1. API Management Service

Understanding how to work with Azure API Management is a core requirement for the AZ-204 exam. This lab demonstrates:

- Creating and configuring APIs in APIM
- Understanding the APIM service structure
- Working with API products and subscriptions
- Managing API access through subscription keys

### 2. API Design and Operations

The exam expects you to understand:

- How to define API operations (GET, POST, DELETE)
- Working with URL paths and template parameters
- Defining request and response schemas
- HTTP status codes and their appropriate usage (200, 201, 204, 404)

This lab covers all of these through hands-on practice with a student management API.

### 3. Policies in API Management

A crucial APIM concept tested in the exam is policy management:

- Understanding inbound processing policies
- Implementing the mocked-response policy
- Knowing when and why to use mock responses
- Applying policies to operations

### 4. API Testing and Consumption

The exam may test your knowledge of:

- How APIs are consumed by clients
- Authentication mechanisms (subscription keys)
- Testing APIs with standard tools
- Understanding API request/response patterns

### 5. REST API Principles

The AZ-204 exam assumes foundational knowledge of REST APIs:

- Resource-based URL design (/students, /students/{id})
- Appropriate use of HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, DELETE for removal)
- Status code meanings (2xx for success, 4xx for client errors)
- JSON as the standard data format

## Practical Exam Scenarios

You might encounter exam questions about:

### Scenario 1: Mock Response Policy

"A development team needs to test their application against an API that hasn't been implemented yet. Which APIM policy should you use?"

Answer: The mocked-response policy allows you to return predefined responses without calling a backend service.

### Scenario 2: API Products and Subscriptions

"How do you control access to APIs in Azure API Management?"

Answer: APIs are added to products, and consumers subscribe to products to receive subscription keys for authentication.

### Scenario 3: API Definitions

"What format does APIM use for defining API request and response schemas?"

Answer: APIM uses JSON Schema definitions, which can reference other definitions using the $ref syntax.

### Scenario 4: Testing APIs

"Which HTTP header is used to authenticate requests to an APIM-hosted API?"

Answer: The Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header contains the subscription key for authentication.

## Real-World Application

Beyond the exam, this lab teaches skills you'll use in production scenarios:

### Enable Parallel Development

In real projects, frontend and backend teams often work simultaneously. Mock APIs allow frontend teams to start development immediately without waiting for backend implementation, reducing overall project timelines.

### API-First Design

Modern development favors designing APIs before implementing them. This ensures:

- Clear contracts between services
- Agreement on data structures and operations
- Better collaboration between teams
- Reduced integration issues

### Contract Testing

Mock APIs serve as the source of truth for API contracts. Teams can:

- Validate that implementations match specifications
- Test error scenarios (404 responses)
- Verify data structures and types
- Ensure consistent behavior

## Exam Preparation Tips

To prepare for APIM-related questions on the AZ-204 exam:

1. Understand the full lifecycle of API management (design, publish, secure, analyze)
2. Know the different types of policies and when to use them
3. Practice creating APIs both manually and by importing specifications
4. Understand how products, APIs, operations, and subscriptions relate to each other
5. Be familiar with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications and how APIM uses them

## Additional Study Areas

While this lab focuses on mocking, the AZ-204 exam also covers:

- Backend integration (connecting APIM to real services)
- Advanced policies (rate limiting, transformation, caching)
- API versioning and revision strategies
- Developer portal configuration
- Monitoring and analytics
- Integration with Azure Active Directory for authentication

## Practice Questions

Consider these scenarios for additional practice:

1. How would you export an API specification from APIM to share with consumers?
2. What happens if a client makes a request without a valid subscription key?
3. How would you version this API to support breaking changes?
4. What policy would you add to limit the number of requests per minute?
5. How could you transform the response to add additional fields?

## Summary

This lab provides hands-on experience with API Management concepts that are directly tested in the AZ-204 exam. The skills you've practiced - creating APIs, defining schemas, implementing policies, and testing with real tools - are all essential for both the exam and real-world Azure development.

Remember: The AZ-204 exam focuses on practical skills. Understanding how to actually implement these solutions in the Azure Portal and with Azure CLI/PowerShell is more important than memorizing facts.

Keep practicing, and good luck with your AZ-204 certification!
