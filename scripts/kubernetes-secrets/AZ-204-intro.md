Great work! This Secrets lab is essential for the Implement Azure Security objective in the AZ-204 exam. Understanding secure credential management is critical for Azure Kubernetes Service.

We'll start by exploring the API specs to understand Secrets versus ConfigMaps where Secrets store sensitive data with base64 encoding and additional access controls while ConfigMaps store non-sensitive configuration in plain text. Know that Secrets are not encrypted by default in etcd requiring encryption at rest configuration. When creating Secrets from encoded YAML, you'll explore consumption methods tested on the exam including environment variables for simple use cases with limitations of visibility to all processes and no automatic updates. The exam tests secret types including Opaque for arbitrary data used in this section.

As we work through creating Secrets from plaintext YAML, you'll understand that base64 is encoding not encryption. The exam tests whether you know that anyone with cluster access can decode Secret values easily. This is why security best practices the exam emphasizes include never committing secrets to source control and using Azure Key Vault for enterprise scenarios.

When working with base-64 Secret values, you'll see how to decode them, demonstrating the minimal security that base64 provides. You'll master Azure Key Vault integration as the recommended approach for production where Secrets Store CSI Driver syncs secrets from Key Vault into pods, managed identity authenticates to Key Vault, secrets appear as mounted volumes in containers, and audit logs track secret access. The exam expects you to know when to use Kubernetes Secrets versus Azure Key Vault.

In the section on creating Secrets from files, you'll explore volume mounts for file-based secrets with automatic updates and better security, and understand the decoupled workflow between configuration management and DevOps teams. The exam tests other secret types including kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson for image pull secrets, kubernetes.io/tls for TLS certificates, and kubernetes.io/service-account-token for service accounts.

The lab challenge explores secret rotation strategies where manual rotation requires updating secrets and restarting pods, and applications should monitor secret files for changes implementing hot-reload. Finally, we'll do cleanup. We'll cover security best practices including implementing RBAC limiting secret access, enabling encryption at rest for etcd, rotating secrets regularly, and using managed identities avoiding credentials in code. The exam includes troubleshooting scenarios where pods stuck in ContainerCreating often indicates missing secrets, image pull failures suggest incorrect registry secrets, and certificate errors point to expired or misconfigured TLS secrets. Master Secrets management and Azure Key Vault integration for the AZ-204!
