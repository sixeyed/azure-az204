Great work! This pods lab is foundational for the Implement containerized solutions objective in the AZ-204 exam. Understanding pod architecture is essential for all Kubernetes work.

We'll start by exploring the API specs to understand pod architecture as the atomic unit in Kubernetes where one or more containers share network namespace, storage volumes, and IPC namespace. Know that while pods can run multiple containers, single-container pods are most common. The exam expects you to understand the four required fields in every Kubernetes resource: apiVersion, kind, metadata, and spec.

When we run a simple Pod, you'll explore the container runtime with Azure Kubernetes Service supporting containerd for OCI-compliant container execution. Understand image pulling from Azure Container Registry, and how Kubernetes works on desired state deployment. The exam tests whether you understand declarative versus imperative approaches, where kubectl apply with YAML manifests is declarative and preferred for production.

As we work through working with Pods, you'll master essential troubleshooting commands. Kubectl logs for viewing container output, kubectl exec for connecting to containers, and kubectl describe for detailed pod information. The exam includes scenarios where you need to troubleshoot failed containers and investigate runtime behavior using these commands. You'll understand pod lifecycle states tested in exam scenarios including Pending when waiting for scheduling or image pulls, Running with at least one container executing, Succeeded for completed batch jobs, Failed when containers exit with errors, and Unknown when kubelet communication fails.

In the section on connecting from one Pod to another, you'll master pod networking concepts the exam tests extensively including pod-to-pod communication via cluster network, how each pod gets a unique IP address, and understanding the flat network model. The exam tests DNS-based service discovery using cluster DNS, network policies for traffic control between pods, and Azure CNI versus kubenet networking modes in AKS.

The lab challenge demonstrates how Pods monitor containers and restart them if they exit, providing the first layer of high availability. Finally, we'll do cleanup. We'll cover multi-container patterns that appear on the exam including sidecar containers for auxiliary functions like logging agents, init containers for setup tasks before main containers start, and ephemeral containers for debugging running pods. You'll master resource management where requests define minimum guaranteed resources used by scheduler for placement decisions, limits define maximum resources preventing container resource exhaustion, and over-commitment occurs when limits exceed node capacity but requests fit. The exam includes security contexts with runAsNonRoot preventing root execution, fsGroup setting volume permissions, and Azure Policy enforcing pod security standards. Master pod concepts for the AZ-204!
