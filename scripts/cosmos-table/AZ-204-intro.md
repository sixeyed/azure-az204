Great work migrating to Cosmos DB Table API! This topic tests your understanding of compatibility layers and migration scenarios. Let's think about what the exam expects you to know from these exercises.

Understanding when to use Table API is important for the exam. Migration scenarios with existing Table Storage apps are the primary use case. Legacy application support where you can't modify code is another key scenario. Simple key-value workloads that don't need SQL API features fit well. Minimal code changes are required with just the connection string needing updates. The exam tests recognizing these scenarios versus when SQL API would be better for complex queries, nested documents, or flexible schema requirements.

The creation pattern requiring both flags is specific to Table API. You must use kind GlobalDocumentDB which creates the Cosmos DB account AND capabilities EnableTable which enables Table API compatibility. Without EnableTable you get SQL API by default. The exam may test the correct command syntax for creating Table API accounts so you need to remember both flags are required.

Connection string compatibility enables seamless migration between Table Storage and Cosmos DB. Table Storage connection strings and Cosmos DB Table API connection strings have identical format. Applications using Azure Data Tables or Microsoft Azure Cosmos Table SDKs work with both. Just update the connection string in configuration with zero code changes. The exam tests understanding of this migration path and why it's so powerful for modernizing legacy applications.

WebJobs for background processing in App Service appear in integration scenarios on the exam. WebJobs run continuously or on schedules within App Service. They share the same App Service Plan as web apps and are good for log processing, scheduled tasks, and message queue processing. The exam tests when to use WebJobs versus Azure Functions which are similar but more flexible with better scaling and event-driven triggers.

Configuration as code best practice separating configuration from code enables zero-downtime changes. Store connection strings in application settings not in code or config files. Change settings in Portal or via CLI without redeploying code. The exam tests understanding of configuration management patterns and the 12-factor app principles.

Structural differences between Table API and SQL API need to be understood for choosing the right API. Table API has Account to Table in a flat structure with no database container. SQL API has Account to Database to Container in a hierarchical structure. Table API is simpler for basic key-value scenarios. SQL API is more powerful for complex data models. The exam tests choosing appropriate API based on requirements. You should also understand Table Storage versus Cosmos DB feature comparison, pricing model differences, partition and row key concepts, query patterns, migration strategies, and common scenarios about modernizing legacy applications and choosing between Table API and SQL API for new projects.
