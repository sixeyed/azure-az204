# Cosmos DB Table API - AZ-204 Exam Connection

This lab covers several key areas of the AZ-204 certification exam, specifically under the develop solutions that use Cosmos DB domain. Understanding the Table API and its relationship to other Azure services is important for the exam.

## Relevant AZ-204 Exam Objectives

The exam tests your ability to create and configure Cosmos DB resources with different API types. Understanding when to use each API and how they differ is crucial. The Table API is specifically designed for migration scenarios and backward compatibility, which distinguishes it from the other Cosmos DB APIs.

Creating and configuring Cosmos DB resources requires understanding different Cosmos DB APIs and when to use each one. The exam will present scenarios where you need to choose the appropriate API for the requirements. Creating Cosmos DB accounts with specific capabilities enabled tests your knowledge of the capabilities flag and how it works with the kind parameter. Configuring Table API as an alternative to traditional Table Storage is a practical skill that appears in migration scenarios. Understanding the differences in structure between API types helps you make informed architectural decisions.

Data operations with tables and entities are fundamental. Working with tables and entities in Cosmos DB, understanding connection strings and authentication, and performing queries against table data are all practical skills you need for real-world applications and exam scenarios.

Migration and compatibility scenarios appear frequently in the exam. Understanding migration paths from legacy Azure services to modern alternatives is important because many organizations have existing applications built on older services. Recognizing when Table API is the appropriate choice requires understanding the trade-offs between different Cosmos DB APIs. Implementing zero-downtime migrations through configuration changes, as demonstrated in this lab, is a valuable technique that can appear in exam scenarios.

## App Service Integration

This lab also touches on App Service objectives that are relevant to the exam. Configuring Web Apps includes setting application configuration and connection strings, using Always On for background workers, deploying applications using ZIP deployment, and working with WebJobs for background processing. These are all practical skills that can appear in various exam scenarios.

Application Settings and Configuration management is a broader topic that extends beyond just this lab. Managing configuration externally from code is a best practice that the exam expects you to understand. Using hierarchical configuration keys like the Serilog settings we configured demonstrates understanding of how .NET configuration works. Updating configuration without redeploying code, as we did when switching from Table Storage to Cosmos DB, is an important operational capability.

## CLI Proficiency

The AZ-204 exam expects you to be comfortable with Azure CLI for managing resources. Creating and managing Cosmos DB resources via Azure CLI is faster and more repeatable than using the Portal. Retrieving connection strings and keys programmatically is essential for automation and scripting. Using query parameters to filter CLI output demonstrates advanced CLI skills. Understanding the structure of complex CLI commands helps you work efficiently and troubleshoot issues.

## Key Exam Concepts

Understanding when to use Table API is critical for exam questions about migration and compatibility. Table API is specifically designed for migration scenarios where you're moving existing Table Storage applications to Cosmos DB. It provides legacy application support by maintaining older codebases without rewrites. For simple key-value workloads where you don't need the query complexity of SQL API, Table API can be the right choice. As a drop-in replacement, it offers Cosmos DB benefits without code changes, which is its primary advantage.

The capabilities flag concept is important to understand for the exam. The capabilities EnableTable flag is different from the kind parameter. Cosmos DB uses a unified engine but exposes different APIs through capabilities. The kind defines the base database type, while capabilities add specific API support. This is intentional design that allows one database engine to support multiple access patterns.

Connection string compatibility is a critical concept for the exam. The Table API connection string format is compatible with Azure Table Storage connection strings by design to enable seamless migration. The application doesn't know or care whether it's connecting to Table Storage or Cosmos DB because the connection string format is identical. This abstraction allows configuration-based migration without code changes.

Understanding the principle of separating configuration from code is fundamental. This lab demonstrated an important architectural principle that appears throughout the exam. We migrated from one data store to another without touching the application code, only by changing configuration. This is a best practice for cloud applications that enables flexibility and easier maintenance.

## Common Exam Questions Patterns

The exam often uses scenario-based questions that test your ability to apply knowledge in realistic situations. You might see a question like: your company has twenty applications using Table Storage and they want to improve global availability and add multi-region writes, what's the fastest migration path? The answer is Table API because it provides backward compatibility with minimal changes.

Command completion questions might ask you to complete a command like: complete this command to create a Cosmos DB account with Table API, providing the kind and capabilities parameters. You need to know that both kind GlobalDocumentDB and capabilities EnableTable are required.

Troubleshooting questions test your understanding of how things work. An application worked with Table Storage but fails after migrating to Cosmos DB Table API, what could be the issue? You need to look for differences in capabilities, query limitations, or configuration errors.

Best practices questions ask when you should choose Table API over SQL API. The answer involves scenarios like legacy application support, migration scenarios, and simple key-value patterns where the complexity of SQL API isn't needed.

## Study Tips

To prepare effectively for the exam, understand the structural differences between APIs. Table API has Account followed by Tables, while SQL API has Account, Database, then Containers. This simpler structure reflects the simpler data model.

Remember the creation pattern of kind GlobalDocumentDB with capabilities EnableTable. Both parts are required and you need to understand why each parameter is necessary.

Practice retrieving connection strings because the CLI query syntax for filtering connection strings is commonly tested. Being able to construct the proper query expression demonstrates practical CLI skills.

Know the migration story because Table API exists primarily for migration scenarios. Understand when and why to use it rather than other APIs. Being able to articulate the trade-offs shows deeper understanding.

Compare with other APIs and be ready to explain why you'd choose Table API over SQL API or vice versa. The exam tests your ability to make informed architectural decisions based on requirements.

## Hands-On Practice

To prepare for the exam, make sure you can create a Cosmos DB Table API account from scratch without referencing documentation. This demonstrates that you understand the concepts rather than just following steps. Switch an application between Table Storage and Cosmos DB Table API to experience the migration process firsthand. Query data using the Table API syntax to understand how it differs from SQL API. Retrieve and use connection strings programmatically for automation scenarios. Understand the pricing and performance implications of the switch because cost optimization appears frequently in exam questions.

## Additional Resources

For comprehensive AZ-204 exam preparation, review the Cosmos DB capacity planning and calculator to understand cost implications. Study Table API query syntax and limitations because these details can appear in exam questions. Understand the differences between Table Storage and Table API beyond just the connection string compatibility. Learn about connection string formats and authentication options for different scenarios. Review WebJobs and background processing in App Service because these skills apply beyond just this lab.

The exam tests practical knowledge rather than memorization. This lab gives you hands-on experience with real migration scenarios you'll see in the field. The ability to switch from Table Storage to Cosmos DB by changing only configuration demonstrates understanding of cloud architecture principles.

Configuration as environment variables or app settings allows you to change runtime behavior without redeploying code. This is a key principle of cloud-native application design that extends beyond just database connections. Understanding these patterns helps you build flexible, maintainable applications that can evolve over time without major rewrites.

WebJobs provide a simple way to run background processes in Azure without needing a full virtual machine or container orchestration. They're perfect for tasks like log processing, scheduled jobs, or continuous background workers. This knowledge is valuable both for the exam and for real-world application development.

The hands-on experience of deploying an application, configuring it with Table Storage, then switching to Cosmos DB without code changes gives you concrete understanding of migration scenarios. This practical experience helps you answer exam questions confidently because you've actually performed these operations rather than just reading about them.

Remember that the exam emphasizes practical application of knowledge. Understanding why Table API exists, what problems it solves, and when to use it is more important than memorizing specific command syntax. The scenarios and trade-offs you learned in this lab prepare you to analyze exam questions and choose the best answer based on the requirements presented.
