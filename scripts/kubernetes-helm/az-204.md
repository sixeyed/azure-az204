## Introduction (20 seconds)

Welcome! If you're preparing for the AZ-204 exam, this video is for you. We're going to focus specifically on the Helm concepts and skills that are relevant for the Microsoft Azure Developer Associate certification.

While Helm itself isn't an Azure service, it's a critical tool for deploying and managing containerized applications on Azure Kubernetes Service, which is definitely covered in the exam.

Let's break down what you need to know.

## AZ-204 Domain: Application Packaging (1 minute)

**[SCREEN: Show AZ-204 exam objectives related to containers]**

The AZ-204 exam tests your ability to develop solutions using containers. Within this domain, you need to understand how to package applications for deployment to AKS.

**[SCREEN: Show Helm chart structure]**

This is where Helm charts come in. A Helm chart is a standardized way to package a Kubernetes application. For the exam, you should understand:

First, the structure of a chart. Know that it contains a Chart file with metadata, a values file with configuration defaults, and template files for your Kubernetes resources.

Second, how charts enable reusability. The same chart can be deployed to development, staging, and production with different configurations. This aligns with the exam's focus on deployment automation and environment management.

Third, version management. Charts have version numbers, allowing you to track changes to your application package over time. This is crucial for maintaining and upgrading applications in production.

**[SCREEN: Highlight key concept]**

Key exam concept: Charts package the application structure and configuration, but NOT the container images themselves. The images are still pulled from container registries like Azure Container Registry.

## AZ-204 Domain: Templating and Configuration (1 minute)

**[SCREEN: Show template example with variables]**

One of Helm's most powerful features is templating, and this concept appears in various forms throughout the AZ-204 exam.

**[SCREEN: Show values.yaml file]**

The values file defines all your configurable parameters. Think of this as your application's configuration contract. You might have values for:
- Number of replicas for scaling
- Resource limits and requests
- Environment-specific settings like connection strings or endpoints
- Feature flags

**[SCREEN: Show template using values]**

In your templates, you reference these values using the Helm templating syntax. The template engine replaces these variables at deployment time.

**[SCREEN: Show multiple deployment scenarios]**

For the exam, understand how this solves real-world problems. Instead of maintaining separate YAML files for each environment, you maintain one chart and multiple values files or override configurations.

This demonstrates infrastructure as code principles - your application configuration is versioned, testable, and repeatable.

**[SCREEN: Highlight exam scenario]**

Common exam scenario: You need to deploy the same application to multiple Azure regions with different configurations. Helm's templating allows you to use one chart with region-specific values files.

## AZ-204 Domain: Deployment Automation (1.5 minutes)

**[SCREEN: Show deployment workflow diagram]**

The exam heavily emphasizes automation, and Helm is a key tool in automated deployment pipelines.

**[SCREEN: Show Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions pipeline]**

In a CI/CD pipeline, Helm commands can be scripted to:
- Install new releases automatically when code is merged
- Upgrade existing releases with new versions
- Roll back automatically if health checks fail

**[SCREEN: Show helm install command]**

The helm install command is idempotent when used properly. You can script it in your pipelines, and if the release already exists, you use helm upgrade instead.

**[SCREEN: Show helm upgrade with rollback]**

This is critical for the exam: understand that Helm maintains release history. Every upgrade creates a new revision, and you can roll back to any previous revision.

**[SCREEN: Show release history example]**

This rollback capability is essential for production reliability. If an upgrade introduces a bug, you can immediately roll back without needing to rebuild or redeploy from source.

**[SCREEN: Highlight exam concept]**

Exam concept: Helm's rollback uses the same ReplicaSet mechanism as Kubernetes rolling updates. The previous ReplicaSet is still there, just scaled to zero. Helm simply scales it back up.

**[SCREEN: Show values override patterns]**

For the exam, also understand the precedence of values:
- Default values in the chart's values file are the lowest priority
- Values from custom values files override defaults
- Values from set flags override everything

This hierarchy lets you define sensible defaults while allowing specific overrides for each deployment.

## AZ-204 Integration: Helm and Azure Services (45 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Show Azure services integration diagram]**

Let's quickly cover how Helm integrates with Azure services you'll see on the exam.

**[SCREEN: Highlight AKS]**

First, Azure Kubernetes Service. Helm is the standard way to deploy applications to AKS. The Helm CLI connects using the credentials you get from the Azure CLI.

**[SCREEN: Highlight ACR]**

Second, Azure Container Registry. Your Helm templates reference images from ACR. You need to ensure your AKS cluster has permissions to pull from ACR - a common exam topic.

**[SCREEN: Highlight Azure DevOps]**

Third, Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions. Both have built-in tasks for Helm commands, making it easy to automate deployments.

**[SCREEN: Highlight Key Vault]**

Fourth, Azure Key Vault. For sensitive configuration like connection strings, you'd typically inject these as environment variables from Key Vault, not hard-code them in Helm values.

---

## Common Exam Scenarios (45 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Show exam scenario list]**

Let me highlight some specific scenarios you might encounter:

Scenario one: "Deploy an application to AKS with different configurations for dev and production environments." Answer: Use Helm with environment-specific values files.

Scenario two: "Enable quick rollback if a deployment causes issues." Answer: Use Helm releases, which maintain deployment history and support rollback commands.

Scenario three: "Standardize application deployment across multiple teams." Answer: Create internal Helm chart repositories where teams can publish and consume charts.

Scenario four: "Deploy a third-party application like Nginx or Prometheus." Answer: Use public Helm repositories to install pre-packaged charts.

**[SCREEN: Highlight security consideration]**

Important for the exam: Always use Helm 3 or later. If you see a question mentioning Tiller, that's Helm 2, which had security issues. The correct answer would involve upgrading to Helm 3.

## Best Practices for AZ-204 (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Show best practices checklist]**

Finally, some best practices that align with exam objectives:

One: Version your charts properly. Use semantic versioning so users know what changes to expect.

Two: Document your values. The values file should include comments explaining each configuration option.

Three: Use chart repositories for sharing. Don't pass around chart archives manually.

Four: Integrate with Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automated deployments.

Five: Never store secrets in values files. Use Azure Key Vault or Kubernetes secrets management.

Six: Test charts in non-production environments before releasing to production.

## Closing (20 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Return to title slide]**

To summarize for the AZ-204 exam: Helm provides application packaging through charts, configuration management through templating and values, and deployment automation through its CLI.

Understanding how Helm integrates with Azure Kubernetes Service, Container Registry, and CI/CD pipelines will serve you well on the exam and in real-world Azure development.

Good luck with your studies and your exam!
