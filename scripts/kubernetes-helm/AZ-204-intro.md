Great work! This Helm lab addresses the Develop solutions using containers domain in the AZ-204 exam. While Helm isn't an Azure service, it's critical for deploying and managing containerized applications on Azure Kubernetes Service.

We'll start by looking at reference documentation so you understand the resources available when working with Helm. As you work through installing the Helm CLI, know that the exam includes security considerations, always using Helm 3 or later as Helm 2's Tiller component had security issues. If questions mention Tiller, that's Helm 2 requiring upgrade to Helm 3.

When we deploy a chart with default values, you'll examine application packaging with Helm charts as the standardized way to package Kubernetes applications. Understand chart structure including the Chart file with metadata, values file with configuration defaults, and template files for Kubernetes resources. Charts enable reusability where the same chart deploys to development, staging, and production with different configurations.

As we install a release with custom values, you'll explore templating and configuration management as one of Helm's most powerful features. The values file defines all configurable parameters like replica counts, resource limits, environment-specific settings, and feature flags. Templates reference these values using Helm syntax that replaces variables at deployment time. The exam tests your understanding of how templating solves real-world problems, where instead of maintaining separate YAML files for each environment, you maintain one chart with multiple values files or override configurations.

In the section on upgrading a release with custom values, you'll master deployment automation as Helm commands script easily in CI/CD pipelines. Helm install creates new releases, helm upgrade updates existing releases, and helm rollback reverts to previous revisions. Know that Helm maintains release history where every upgrade creates a new revision enabling rollback to any previous state. We'll cover values precedence that the exam expects you to understand where default values in chart's values file are lowest priority, custom values files override defaults, and set flags override everything.

When using chart repositories, you'll see how Helm enables package sharing similar to Docker Hub. The exam tests whether you understand best practices including versioning charts properly using semantic versioning, documenting values with comments, and using repositories for sharing. You'll understand Azure service integration with Helm charts referencing images from Azure Container Registry requiring AKS cluster permissions, Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions having built-in tasks for Helm commands enabling automation, and Azure Key Vault for sensitive configuration injected as environment variables not hard-coded in Helm values.

In the lab challenge, you'll practice using values files for complex configuration instead of multiple set flags. Finally, we'll do cleanup. Never store secrets in values files, use Key Vault instead, and test charts in non-production before production releases. Master Helm for application packaging and deployment automation in the AZ-204!
