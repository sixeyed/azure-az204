Great work with SignalR! This service appears in the AZ-204 exam's compute solutions domain, focusing on real-time communication capabilities.

When you ran a local SignalR website and saw the scaling problem with multiple instances, that demonstrated exactly why SignalR Service exists. The exam tests understanding of these scaling considerations. Without Azure SignalR Service, each web server maintains its own client connections in memory, causing users on different servers to not communicate. SignalR Service provides a centralized hub architecture where all web servers send to the service, which broadcasts to all clients. This enables stateless web applications that easily scale horizontally. You also saw that SignalR doesn't provide a persistence layer. It broadcasts messages in real-time but doesn't store them, which is an important limitation the exam may test.

Creating SignalR Service showed you the service configuration and deployment options. The exam tests CLI commands for creating SignalR resources and understanding SKU selection. Free tier is for development and testing with connection limits. Standard tier is for production workloads. Premium tier provides higher scale and enhanced features. The service name becomes part of a public DNS endpoint at your-name.service.signalr.net. You also saw different authentication approaches including connection strings with access keys for simpler getting started, and connection strings for Managed Identities which are the preferred production approach.

When you deployed the SignalR website to Azure, you used App Service integration which is a key pattern the exam covers. Web applications connect to SignalR Service to broadcast messages, configured through app settings using Azure__SignalR__Enabled and Azure__SignalR__ConnectionString. Notice the double-underscore syntax which is how hierarchical configuration works in app settings. The exam also covers Azure Functions integration which uses SignalR bindings for serverless architectures, and you need to understand the different service modes. Default mode manages both server and client connections. Serverless mode is for Azure Functions integration where only clients connect to the service. Classic mode provides legacy behavior for backward compatibility.

The authentication and authorization setup you did is critical for the exam. You learned the separation of authentication and authorization. Authentication proves identity, which the Managed Identity handles. Authorization grants permissions through role assignments. You needed to assign the SignalR App Server role to the App Service's Managed Identity. The exam tests knowing the specific SignalR roles. SignalR App Server is for application servers managing connections and sending messages. SignalR Service Owner provides full access. SignalR REST API Owner and Reader control REST API access. The exam may present scenarios where you need to choose which role to assign.

In the lab where you used the trace tool, that relates to monitoring with Live Trace for debugging message flow. This is important for troubleshooting scenarios on the exam. The exam also tests understanding of connection string formats. With Managed Identities, the format uses AuthType=azure.msi and doesn't include the access key. With access keys, the connection string includes the endpoint and embedded credentials. You need to know when to use each approach and how to configure them in app settings.
