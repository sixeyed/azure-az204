Great work with Table Storage! This is an important topic for the AZ-204 exam's "Develop solutions that use Azure Storage" domain.

When you created a table and added entities with different structures, you learned Table Storage fundamentals that must be understood. Entities are data units analogous to rows in SQL databases. Partition Key is part of the unique identifier determining physical storage location affecting performance and scalability. Row Key is the unique part of identifier, and together partition and row keys form a composite primary key uniquely identifying each entity. The exam tests understanding of this terminology and structure. Schema flexibility is a key differentiator where Table Storage does not enforce a fixed schema. Entities within the same table can have completely different properties which is fundamentally different from relational databases. The exam may test understanding of when this flexibility is advantageous versus when it could cause issues.

Querying Table Storage with OData taught you about querying patterns that appear on the exam. OData REST API provides standardized querying over HTTP. URL format appends table name to endpoint. Filter by PartitionKey and RowKey for most efficient queries. Response formats include XML default or JSON with Accept headers. The exam may test OData query syntax and usage patterns. Authentication methods are critical too. Connection strings include account name, account key, and endpoints. Shared Access Signatures provide time-limited access with specific permissions and duration. Three types are User delegation SAS which is most secure using Azure AD, Service SAS, and Account SAS. Azure AD Authentication is preferred for applications using managed identities. The exam tests choosing appropriate security methods.

Using table storage as a log sink demonstrated integration scenarios and partition key design that's critical for performance questions. Good partition keys distribute data evenly avoiding hot partitions with disproportionate traffic. Consider query patterns when designing keys. The reverse chronological timestamp pattern you saw is clever because recent logs come first. The exam tests recognizing good versus bad partition key designs. For logging and diagnostics, Table Storage works as a sink for application logs with timestamp-based partition strategies. Cost optimization means no cost for empty tables, you pay per transaction and storage used.

The exam also covers Cosmos DB migration path which is testable. Cosmos DB Table API provides compatibility with Table Storage enabling migration. The exam tests understanding of when to choose Table Storage versus Cosmos DB based on requirements like global distribution, low latency SLAs, and complex queries. Understanding CLI commands like az storage table create and az storage table generate-sas is important, as well as technical limits like 1 MB max entity size, 64 KB max property size, and 255 max properties per entity.
