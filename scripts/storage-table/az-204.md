# Azure Table Storage - AZ-204 Exam Focus

## Exam Relevance

For the AZ-204 exam, Azure Table Storage is an important topic within the "Develop solutions that use Azure Storage" domain. While it's considered a legacy service compared to Cosmos DB, you'll still need to understand when and how to use it, as it appears in many existing Azure solutions.

## Key Exam Topics

### 1. Table Storage Fundamentals

For the exam, you must understand these core concepts:

**Entities** are the fundamental data units in Table Storage. Each entity is analogous to a row in a relational database, but with more flexibility.

**Partition Key** is critical for both the exam and real-world implementation. This is part of the entity's unique identifier and determines data distribution across Azure's infrastructure. Understanding partition key design is crucial for performance and scalability questions.

**Row Key** completes the unique identifier when combined with the partition key. Together, they form the primary key for the entity.

### 2. Schema Flexibility

A key exam point: Table Storage does NOT enforce a fixed schema. Entities within the same table can have completely different properties. This is a fundamental difference from relational databases and could appear in scenario-based questions comparing different storage options.

You might see exam questions testing your understanding of when this flexibility is advantageous versus when it could cause issues.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

The exam will test your knowledge of authentication methods for Table Storage:

**Connection Strings** include the account name, account key, and endpoints for all storage services. You need to know the format and when to use connection strings versus other authentication methods.

**Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** are crucial for the exam. Understand:
- How to generate SAS tokens with specific permissions
- Token expiry and time-based access control
- Fine-grained access control at the table, partition, or row level
- The difference between account-level and resource-level SAS tokens

**Azure AD Authentication** is increasingly important in modern Azure solutions and may appear in security-focused questions.

### 4. Querying Data

For the exam, understand these querying approaches:

**OData REST API** - While less common in practice, you should know:
- The URL format for OData queries
- How to filter by PartitionKey and RowKey
- Response formats (XML vs JSON)
- The Accept header for controlling response format

**Client Libraries** - More commonly used in practice and likely to appear in code-based exam questions:
- The Azure.Data.Tables SDK for .NET
- How to perform CRUD operations programmatically
- Async operations and best practices

### 5. Design Patterns and Best Practices

Exam questions often test your ability to design effective table storage solutions:

**Partition Key Design** is critical for performance:
- Good partition keys distribute data evenly
- Avoid "hot" partitions that receive disproportionate traffic
- Consider query patterns when designing keys
- Understand the impact on parallel operations

**Row Key Design** should support your query requirements:
- Can include timestamps for time-series data
- Should enable efficient range queries when needed
- Combined with partition key to ensure uniqueness

### 6. Integration Scenarios

The exam tests real-world integration knowledge:

**Logging and Diagnostics** - Table Storage as a sink for application logs:
- Integration with logging frameworks like Serilog
- Timestamp-based partition strategies for log data
- Querying and analyzing log data

**Cost Optimization** - Understanding the pricing model:
- No cost for empty tables
- Pay per transaction and storage used
- Compared to alternatives like Cosmos DB

### 7. Cosmos DB Migration Path

An important exam point: the relationship between Table Storage and Cosmos DB:

- Cosmos DB Table API provides compatibility with Table Storage
- Migration path from Table Storage to Cosmos DB
- When to choose one over the other
- Performance and feature differences

### 8. Common Exam Scenarios

Be prepared for questions like:

**"You need a simple, cost-effective storage solution for semi-structured data that doesn't require complex queries. Which option should you choose?"**
- Answer: Table Storage is often the correct choice here

**"Your application experiences performance issues with Table Storage. All requests are hitting the same partition. What should you do?"**
- Answer: Redesign the partition key strategy for better distribution

**"You need to provide time-limited access to a specific table for a third-party application. What should you use?"**
- Answer: Generate a SAS token with appropriate permissions and expiry

**"You're building a new application that needs global distribution and single-digit millisecond latency. Should you use Table Storage?"**
- Answer: No, use Cosmos DB instead

### 9. CLI Commands to Know

For the exam, be familiar with these Azure CLI commands:

- `az storage account create` - Creating storage accounts
- `az storage table create` - Creating tables
- `az storage table generate-sas` - Generating access tokens
- `az storage account show-connection-string` - Getting connection strings

You don't need to memorize exact syntax, but understand what each command does and when to use it.

### 10. Limitations and Constraints

Know these technical limits for the exam:

- Maximum entity size: 1 MB
- Maximum property size: 64 KB for strings
- Maximum number of properties per entity: 255
- Partition key and row key size: up to 1 KB each

## Comparison with Other Services

A common exam question type involves comparing storage options. Understand when to choose:

**Table Storage** when you need:
- Simple NoSQL storage
- Cost-effective solution
- Integration with existing storage accounts
- Semi-structured data without complex queries

**Cosmos DB** when you need:
- Global distribution
- Low latency SLAs
- Complex queries and indexing
- Multiple API options

**Blob Storage** when you need:
- Unstructured data storage
- Large files or media content
- Object storage

## Practice Recommendations

To prepare for Table Storage questions on the AZ-204 exam:

1. Practice creating and querying tables using both the Azure CLI and Portal
2. Understand partition key design patterns deeply
3. Work with SAS tokens and understand permission models
4. Practice code-based scenarios using the SDK
5. Review cost optimization strategies
6. Understand the migration path to Cosmos DB

## Final Exam Tips

Remember for the exam:

- Table Storage is part of Storage Accounts, not a standalone service
- Schema flexibility is both an advantage and a consideration
- Partition key design directly impacts performance and scalability
- SAS tokens are the preferred method for delegated access
- Consider Table Storage for simple scenarios, Cosmos DB for complex ones
- Understand the relationship and migration path between Table Storage and Cosmos DB

Good luck with your AZ-204 exam preparation!
