# App Service for Distributed Apps - AZ-204 Exam Relevance

## AZ-204 Exam Objectives

This lab directly addresses several key objectives from the AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure certification exam.

### Primary Exam Domain: Implement Azure App Service Web Apps (15-20%)

This lab covers multiple skills within this domain:

#### 1. Create and Configure Azure App Service

**Exam Skills Covered:**
- Create an App Service plan

- Create an App Service web app
- Configure deployment settings for an App Service

**In This Lab:**
- You created an App Service Plan with specific SKU (B1) and worker count configurations
- You deployed multiple web apps to a single App Service Plan, demonstrating resource optimization
- You learned about SKU limitations and how to scale App Service Plans
- You used `az webapp up` for automated deployment
- You experienced how deployment methods can affect your App Service Plan configuration

#### 2. Configure Web App Settings

**Exam Skills Covered:**
- Configure application settings
- Configure connection strings
- Configure general settings (runtime version, OS)
- Enable diagnostic logging

**In This Lab:**
- You configured application settings to enable communication between distributed components
- You learned how App Service configuration overrides application defaults
- You set runtime versions and OS types during deployment
- You reviewed deployment logs and diagnostics

#### 3. Scale Apps in Azure App Service

**Exam Skills Covered:**
- Configure auto-scaling
- Manually scale apps
- Understand different pricing tiers and their capabilities

**In This Lab:**
- You manually scaled an App Service Plan from 2 to 3 workers
- You discovered SKU limitations (F1 vs B1) and their impact on scaling
- You experienced the relationship between SKU tier and maximum worker count
- You observed how Azure distributes load across multiple instances

### Secondary Exam Domain: Develop for Azure Storage (15-20%)

#### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

**Exam Skills Covered:**
- Configure CORS for Azure services
- Implement CORS for Azure Storage
- Understand security implications of CORS

**In This Lab:**
- You encountered CORS restrictions when calling an API from a different domain
- You learned how to configure CORS settings for App Service
- You understood the security reasoning behind CORS policies

### Secondary Exam Domain: Implement Authentication and Secure Data (20-25%)

#### Configuration Management

**Exam Skills Covered:**
- Implement secure configuration management
- Separate configuration from code
- Use App Service configuration for environment-specific values

**In This Lab:**
- You separated API endpoint URLs from application code using App Service configuration
- You learned the pattern for managing different configurations across environments
- You understood how to override default application settings without modifying code

## Key Exam Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-App Service Deployments

**Why This Matters for AZ-204:**
The exam often tests your understanding of cost optimization and resource management. Deploying multiple apps to a single App Service Plan is a common real-world scenario and a best practice for development/test environments.

**Key Takeaway:** You can run multiple App Services on a single App Service Plan to share compute resources and reduce costs.

### 2. Configuration as Environment Variables

**Why This Matters for AZ-204:**
The exam emphasizes secure development practices. Using App Service configuration instead of hardcoding values is a fundamental principle you'll be tested on.

**Key Takeaway:** App Service configuration settings are injected as environment variables, allowing the same code to run in different environments with different configurations.

### 3. Deployment Automation

**Why This Matters for AZ-204:**
Understanding different deployment methods and their automation is crucial. The exam may test your knowledge of deployment slots, continuous deployment, and various deployment tools.

**Key Takeaway:** Commands like `az webapp up` automate multiple steps, but you need to understand what they do and their potential side effects (like changing your App Service Plan SKU).

### 4. Scaling Strategies

**Why This Matters for AZ-204:**
The exam tests your ability to choose appropriate scaling strategies based on requirements and constraints.

**Key Takeaway:** Different pricing tiers have different scaling limits. You must choose the right tier for your scaling requirements, and you can scale both up (changing SKU) and out (adding instances).

### 5. Service Communication

**Why This Matters for AZ-204:**
Understanding how distributed components communicate, including networking and security concerns like CORS, is essential for the exam.

**Key Takeaway:** App Service apps can communicate via HTTP/HTTPS, but you must configure CORS for browser-based cross-origin requests.

## Common Exam Question Patterns

Based on this lab, you might see exam questions like:

1. **Scenario-Based Questions:**
   - "You have a web app and an API that need to run in Azure. How can you minimize costs while maintaining separate deployments?"
   - "Your application needs to connect to different database endpoints in development and production. What is the recommended approach?"

2. **Configuration Questions:**
   - "Which App Service setting would you use to inject environment-specific values into a .NET application?"
   - "How do you configure hierarchical configuration keys in App Service for .NET Core applications?"

3. **Scaling Questions:**
   - "Your App Service Plan is on the Free tier. What must you do before scaling to 3 instances?"
   - "What command would you use to both change the SKU and scale out an App Service Plan?"

4. **Security Questions:**
   - "A single-page application hosted in Azure Static Web Apps cannot call your API in App Service. What configuration is needed?"
   - "What security mechanism prevents cross-origin API calls by default?"

## Study Tips

### Hands-On Practice
- The AZ-204 exam emphasizes practical skills. Make sure you can perform these tasks without looking at documentation:
  - Create App Service Plans with specific configurations
  - Deploy applications using multiple methods
  - Configure application settings
  - Scale App Service Plans

### Understand the "Why"
- Don't just memorize commands. Understand why you'd use each approach:
  - Why use configuration instead of hardcoding values?
  - Why share an App Service Plan across multiple apps?
  - Why does CORS exist and when do you need it?

### CLI vs Portal
- The exam may test both Azure Portal knowledge and Azure CLI commands
- Practice both approaches for each task
- Remember that CLI commands are often easier to remember if you understand their parameter patterns

### Pricing Tier Knowledge
- Know the capabilities and limitations of each App Service Plan tier
- Understand when to use Free/Shared vs Basic vs Standard vs Premium
- Remember that some features are only available in higher tiers

### Configuration Patterns
- Understand how different platforms (NET, Node.js, Python) read configuration
- Know the precedence order when multiple configuration sources exist
- Remember the double underscore (`__`) syntax for hierarchical keys in App Service

## Additional Study Resources

To supplement this lab for AZ-204 preparation:

1. **App Service Documentation:**
   - Review the official documentation on App Service plans and pricing

   - Configure custom domains and SSL certificates
   - Implement deployment slots for staging

3. **Security Deep Dive:**
   - Study managed identities for App Service
   - Learn about Key Vault integration
   - Understand network isolation options
