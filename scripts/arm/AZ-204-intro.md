Great work with ARM template deployments! Infrastructure as code is an important AZ-204 exam topic covering deployment automation and consistency. Let's think about what the exam expects you to know from these exercises.

The declarative versus imperative approaches concept is fundamental to understand. Imperative means using Azure CLI commands where you specify step-by-step how to create resources, you control the order, and you must handle dependencies yourself. Declarative means using ARM templates where you specify what you want and Azure figures out the order and handles dependencies automatically. The exam tests when to use each approach, with CLI being better for quick one-off tasks and templates being better for repeatable production deployments.

Understanding ARM template structure is essential for the exam. The parameters section defines inputs with environment-specific values like names and SKUs. The variables section contains reusable values calculated from parameters. The resources section declares what to deploy, which is the actual infrastructure. The outputs section returns values for use by other templates or scripts. The exam tests your ability to read and understand template structure, so you need to recognize these sections and know what each one does.

Idempotent operations are critical to grasp. Templates should produce the same result when deployed multiple times without creating duplicate resources or throwing errors. Azure checks if resources already exist and updates them to match the template rather than failing or creating duplicates. The exam tests understanding of idempotency and your ability to recognize when templates aren't idempotent, like when you use dynamic IP allocation instead of static addresses.

What-if operations for deployment validation appear frequently on the exam. This feature previews changes without applying them, showing what will be created, modified, or deleted. This helps catch mistakes before they affect production. The exam tests when to use what-if for validation and how to interpret its output.

Configuration drift detection uses what-if to identify when actual infrastructure differs from the template. If someone manually changes resources through the Portal or CLI outside of your infrastructure code, what-if shows the discrepancy. The exam tests understanding of drift and how templates help maintain consistency across deployments.

Deployment scopes need to be known for different scenarios. Resource group scope is most common for application resources. Subscription scope is for policy and budget resources. Management group scope is for cross-subscription governance. Tenant scope is for tenant-wide resources. The exam focuses mainly on resource group deployments for application scenarios. You should also understand parameter files for environment-specific values, linking templates for modular deployments, and deployment modes where incremental adds or updates resources while complete mode removes unlisted resources. The exam includes common scenarios about troubleshooting template errors and organizing infrastructure code. Master ARM templates for the AZ-204!
