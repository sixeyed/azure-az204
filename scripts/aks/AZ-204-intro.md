Great work deploying your first AKS cluster! Now let's focus on what the AZ-204 exam expects you to know about Azure Kubernetes Service.

AKS appears in the implement containerized solutions domain of the AZ-204 exam. While you won't be expected to be a Kubernetes expert, you need to understand how to deploy and manage containerized applications using AKS, and how AKS integrates with other Azure services.

Creating and managing AKS clusters is the foundation. You need to know the az aks create command with its essential parameters: resource group, cluster name, location, node count, and VM sizes. The exam frequently tests your understanding of the managed resource group, which is automatically created with a name prefixed by MC underscore. This managed resource group contains all the underlying infrastructure like VMs, network interfaces, load balancers, and network security groups. The critical rule to remember is that you should never manually modify resources in this managed group. All interactions should go through the AKS resource using kubectl or az aks commands.

Connecting to AKS clusters is fundamental exam knowledge. You need to know the az aks get-credentials command that downloads cluster credentials and configures kubectl. This command modifies your kubeconfig file to enable kubectl communication with your AKS cluster. The exam may also touch on Azure Active Directory integration and service principals for production authentication scenarios, so understand those options as well.

Deploying applications to AKS requires understanding key Kubernetes resources. Deployments define how apps run, including container images, replicas, and update strategies. Services expose apps to network traffic either internally or externally. ConfigMaps store configuration data like environment variables or configuration files. Secrets store sensitive data like connection strings and passwords. You need to know the kubectl apply command with the -f flag for deploying YAML manifests, and understand that you can point it at a single file, a directory, or even a URL.

Scaling applications appears frequently on the exam. Understand horizontal pod scaling using kubectl scale deployment or by modifying the replicas field in your YAML manifest and reapplying. Also know about cluster scaling, which means adding or removing nodes using the az aks scale command. The exam may present scenarios where you need to choose between scaling pods versus scaling the cluster itself.

Integration with Azure Container Registry is a key exam topic that comes up repeatedly. AKS can pull images from ACR without additional authentication when properly configured using managed identity. Know how to attach ACR to AKS using az aks update with the attach-acr parameter. The exam loves questions about the most secure way to pull private images, and managed identity is always the preferred answer over service principals or passwords.

Monitoring and diagnostics involves understanding how to view pod logs with kubectl logs, describe resources with kubectl describe for detailed status information, and access container metrics through Azure Monitor. The exam may test troubleshooting scenarios where pods aren't starting correctly, images can't be pulled, or containers are crashing, so know how to investigate these issues.

AKS networking concepts are important for the exam. ClusterIP creates internal-only services that aren't accessible from outside the cluster. LoadBalancer creates external services with public IP addresses provisioned by Azure. NodePort services expose your app on a static port on each node. Understanding when to use each service type is crucial for exam scenarios.

Node pools let you have different VM types in the same cluster. You might have Linux nodes for general workloads, GPU nodes for machine learning tasks, and Windows nodes for legacy .NET Framework applications. Know that you can have multiple node pools with different configurations all serving different workload requirements within a single cluster.

Throughout our review, we'll explore common exam scenarios: choosing between ACI and AKS for different workload types, implementing horizontal pod autoscaling, integrating with ACR securely using managed identity, and troubleshooting common deployment issues like image pull failures or pod scheduling problems.
