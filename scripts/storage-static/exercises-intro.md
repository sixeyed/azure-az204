We've covered Azure Storage static website hosting as a cost-effective, scalable solution for hosting static web content without managing traditional web servers - uploading HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images as blobs with public web access. Now let's deploy and distribute a static website globally.

We'll start by deploying a static website by enabling static website hosting on a storage account. You'll use the blob service-properties update command which creates the special dollar-sign web container with unique properties. Blobs inside aren't directly accessible via standard blob endpoint but are served through the static website endpoint instead. You'll specify index.html as the default landing page and 404.html as the custom error page. Then you'll upload web content using the blob upload-batch command to the web container, preserving directory structure from local files. Once uploaded, your site loads correctly with all styles and images. You'll understand the dual access model: blob endpoint access is not publicly accessible even when static website is enabled, but static website endpoint access provides public access through the dedicated static website domain.

Next you'll implement replication to a second region for high availability by upgrading to RA-GRS which is Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage. Your content is automatically replicated to a secondary region hundreds of miles away. The secondary endpoint is read-only but provides additional access if the primary region becomes unavailable. Geo-replication isn't instantaneous, so you'll monitor replication status checking lastSyncTime to verify synchronization completion. This gives you built-in high availability and disaster recovery without any additional configuration.

After setting up replication, you'll enable global replication with CDN by creating a CDN profile and endpoint pointing to your static website. The CDN caches content at edge locations worldwide, serving users from the nearest point of presence rather than your storage account directly. This reduces latency, improves performance, reduces load on origin, and provides better scalability for global audiences. The origin-host-header parameter ensures the CDN sends correct host headers when requesting content from your origin. You'll understand CDN caching behavior by uploading new content and observing that the origin shows updates immediately but the CDN continues showing cached content. This aggressive caching is intentional for performance but requires purge operations to force CDN cache refresh and push new content immediately to all edge locations.

For the lab challenge, you'll explore additional CDN features and configurations to optimize content delivery and understand how to troubleshoot common issues like stale content in the cache. When you're done, you'll clean up by deleting the resource group.
