# Static Websites with Azure Storage - AZ-204 Exam Introduction

Great work with static websites! This topic supports multiple AZ-204 exam domains including storage, compute, and CDN.

## What We'll Cover

**Static website configuration** is testable on the exam. Enabling requires setting specific blob service properties with `az storage blob service-properties update --static-website`. The $web container is automatically created with special access rules - blobs aren't directly accessible via blob endpoint but are served through static website endpoint. Two document types must be configured: index document (default page for root URL or directories) and 404 error document (custom error page for missing content). The static website endpoint is distinct from blob endpoint with format like https://[account].[region].web.core.windows.net. The exam tests understanding of this configuration.

**Storage redundancy for static websites** appears frequently. LRS (3 copies in one datacenter, lowest cost) for development. GRS (6 copies across two regions, no read access to secondary) for geo-redundancy. RA-GRS (6 copies with read access to secondary region) is particularly useful for static websites providing high availability through geographic distribution, read access from secondary region, lower cost than full read-write, and automatic failover capabilities. ZRS (3 copies across availability zones) and GZRS (zone-redundant in primary, geo-redundant to secondary) for highest protection. The exam tests choosing redundancy based on availability requirements.

**Access patterns and security** demonstrate layered security. Blob endpoint access: direct blob URLs are NOT publicly accessible even when static website is enabled. Static website endpoint access: public access through dedicated static website domain. This dual model is crucial - the exam may present scenarios requiring you to choose the appropriate access method. Understanding why blob access is blocked provides security context.

**Azure CDN integration** spans multiple exam domains. CDN Profiles are containers for CDN endpoints defining pricing tier (Standard_Microsoft, Standard_Akamai, Standard_Verizon, Premium_Verizon). CDN Endpoints are the actual domain names users access at [endpoint].azureedge.net. Origin is the source of content - static website endpoint in this case. Origin-host-header must match the static website domain for proper routing. Caching behavior: content is cached at edge locations globally for performance. Purge operations force CDN to refresh cached content. The exam tests CDN deployment and management.

**Content delivery and propagation** timing is testable. Initial propagation time: CDN endpoints take several minutes (up to 15) to become active globally. Cache duration: content remains cached based on CDN rules and HTTP headers. Update propagation: changes to origin don't immediately reflect in CDN requiring cache awareness. Purge operations use `az cdn endpoint purge` with content paths to force immediate updates. The exam may test troubleshooting scenarios where users see stale content.

**Comparison with alternatives** helps with service selection. Static websites on blob storage are typically lowest cost option compared to Azure App Service static site hosting, virtual machines with web servers, or container-based solutions. Use static websites when content doesn't require server-side processing. Use App Service when you need server-side logic, SSL certificates, or custom domains. The exam tests choosing appropriate hosting based on requirements.

We'll cover **CLI commands** (`az storage blob service-properties update --static-website`, `az storage blob upload-batch -d '$web'`, `az storage account update --sku Standard_RAGRS`, `az cdn profile create`, `az cdn endpoint create`, `az cdn endpoint purge`), **endpoint URL formats** (primary endpoint, secondary endpoint, CDN endpoint, blob endpoint), **integration with other services** (Azure Front Door as alternative to CDN, Azure DNS for custom domains, Azure Monitor for logging and metrics), **cost optimization** (storage costs, redundancy costs, CDN costs based on data transfer and requests, egress charges), and **common scenarios** about hosting marketing sites, documentation portals, SPAs, and troubleshooting stale content in CDN.
