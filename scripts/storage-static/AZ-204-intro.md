Great work with static websites! This topic supports multiple AZ-204 exam domains including storage, compute, and CDN.

When you deployed a static website, you learned about static website configuration that's testable on the exam. Enabling requires setting specific blob service properties and the dollar-sign web container is automatically created with special access rules. Blobs aren't directly accessible via blob endpoint but are served through static website endpoint. Two document types must be configured: index document as the default page and 404 error document for missing content. The static website endpoint is distinct from blob endpoint with a specific format. The exam tests understanding of this configuration and the access patterns demonstrating layered security. Blob endpoint access means direct blob URLs are not publicly accessible even when static website is enabled. Static website endpoint access provides public access through the dedicated static website domain. This dual model is crucial for exam scenarios.

Implementing replication to a second region taught you about storage redundancy that appears frequently. LRS with 3 copies in one datacenter is lowest cost for development. GRS with 6 copies across two regions provides geo-redundancy with no read access to secondary. RA-GRS with 6 copies and read access to secondary region is particularly useful for static websites providing high availability through geographic distribution, read access from secondary region, lower cost than full read-write, and automatic failover capabilities. ZRS and GZRS provide zone redundancy. The exam tests choosing redundancy based on availability requirements.

When you enabled global replication with CDN, that covered Azure CDN integration which spans multiple exam domains. CDN Profiles are containers for CDN endpoints defining pricing tier like Standard Microsoft, Standard Akamai, Standard Verizon, or Premium Verizon. CDN Endpoints are the actual domain names users access. Origin is the source of content which is your static website endpoint. Origin-host-header must match the static website domain for proper routing. Caching behavior means content is cached at edge locations globally for performance. The exam tests CDN deployment and management.

Understanding CDN caching behavior taught you about content delivery and propagation timing that's testable. Initial propagation time means CDN endpoints take several minutes up to 15 to become active globally. Cache duration means content remains cached based on CDN rules and HTTP headers. Update propagation means changes to origin don't immediately reflect in CDN requiring cache awareness. Purge operations force immediate updates. The exam may test troubleshooting scenarios where users see stale content, and knowing how to use purge operations is critical.

The comparison with alternatives helps with service selection. Static websites on blob storage are typically lowest cost option compared to Azure App Service static site hosting, virtual machines with web servers, or container-based solutions. Use static websites when content doesn't require server-side processing. Use App Service when you need server-side logic or custom domains. Understanding CLI commands like storage blob service-properties update, storage blob upload-batch, cdn profile create, cdn endpoint create, and cdn endpoint purge is important for the exam.
