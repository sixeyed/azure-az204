# What is Azure Container Registry?

<div class="mt-8 text-lg">

Azure Container Registry, or ACR, is Azure's private container registry service. While open source applications are commonly published to public registries like Docker Hub, organizations need secure, private registries for their own applications. ACR provides this capability with full Azure integration.
