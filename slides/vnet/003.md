# What are Virtual Networks?

<div class="mt-8 text-lg">

Virtual Networks, or VNets as they're commonly called, are private networks in Azure. They allow your services to communicate with each other securely, without being exposed to the public Internet. Think of a VNet as your own private datacenter network in the cloud.
