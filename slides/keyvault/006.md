# Recovery and Protection Features

<div class="mt-8">

<iconify-icon icon="mdi:check-circle" class="text-green-500" /> **Soft delete** - Automatically enabled on new vaults. When you delete a secret, it's retained for a recovery period (default 90 days) before permanent deletion.

<iconify-icon icon="mdi:check-circle" class="text-green-500" /> **Purge protection** - When enabled, prevents anyone from permanently deleting secrets during the retention period. This is critical for production environments.
