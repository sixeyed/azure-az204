# What are Storage Accounts?

<div class="mt-8 text-lg">

Azure Storage Accounts are a managed storage service that allows you to store data in the cloud. You have complete control over who can access your data - you can make it publicly accessible, restrict it to specific users, or limit access to other Azure services.
