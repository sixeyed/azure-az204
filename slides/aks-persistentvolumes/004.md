# The Demo Application

<div class="mt-8">

For this lab, we'll be using a simple .NET 6.0 background worker application. This app reads configuration from files and writes data to various locations. It's perfect for demonstrating different storage patterns because we can easily see what happens to the data as we manipulate Pods and volumes.
