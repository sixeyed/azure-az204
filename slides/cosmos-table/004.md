# Lab Overview

<div class="mt-8">

In today's lab, we'll explore the Table API hands-on. We'll run an application that writes to Table Storage, and then we'll switch it to using Cosmos DB with just a configuration change. This demonstrates the true power of the Table API - seamless migration with zero code changes.
