# What Are Azure Virtual Machines?

<div class="mt-8 text-lg">

Virtual Machines in Azure are isolated compute environments running a full operating system. You have complete administrative permissions to install and configure whatever software you need. Azure supports both Linux and Windows VMs, with a large selection of preconfigured images and compute sizes to choose from.
