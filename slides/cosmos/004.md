# Understanding the NoSQL Driver

<div class="mt-8 text-lg">

Here's something that might confuse you at first: NoSQL is the native driver for CosmosDB, but it was previously called the SQL driver. You'll see it referred to as "NoSQL" in the Azure Portal, but the CLI and documentation still call it the "SQL" driver. Keep this in mind to avoid confusion.
