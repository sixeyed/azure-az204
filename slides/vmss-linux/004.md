# What is cloud-init?

<div class="mt-8 text-lg">

cloud-init is a powerful cross-platform system for configuring new machines. It allows you to automate all the usual steps for deploying pre-requisites, installing applications, and writing configuration files. Azure has excellent support for cloud-init on Linux VMs, making it an ideal choice for VM Scale Set deployments.
