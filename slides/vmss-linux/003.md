# Context and Motivation

<div class="mt-8 text-lg">

When working with VM Scale Sets, you have two main approaches for getting your application running on instances. The first approach is to use a custom image that contains your application pre-installed. This means instances can start work immediately when they come online with no additional setup required. However, this approach makes upgrades more complex because you need to build a new image every time you have a new release of your application.
